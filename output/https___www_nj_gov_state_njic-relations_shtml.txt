Tahesha Way, Secretary of State New Jersey – Israel Relations The State of New Jersey is proud to have a long, historic, and strong relationship with the State of Israel beginning from the establishment of modern Israel and officially recognized through our Sister State Agreement in 1988. Based on our shared values and ideals, New Jersey’s special partnership with Israel today is defined not only through our many communities who feel connected to the Holy Land, but to the countless technological, academic, commercial, governmental, and cultural connections we have that continue to drive our relations into the future. Today’s bridge between New Jersey and Israel is especially defined by the importance of increasing trade and investment and ensuring that emerging technologies critical to New Jersey’s industries are included. Additionally, the Commission continues to explore all areas that can enhance quality of life of New Jersey’s citizens. In recent years both Governor Phil Murphy, Secretary of State Tahesha Way, and other senior officials from New Jersey have visited Israel and focused on building upon these relations to benefit New Jersey and strengthen the bond between our communities. In 2019, the value of bilateral trade between New Jersey and Israel was valued at $1.27B and Israel has continued to be a notable source of job creation and foreign direct investment into New Jersey. According to U.S. Census data, New Jersey retains the fourth largest populations of people born in Israel and those having Israeli ancestry in the United States.
