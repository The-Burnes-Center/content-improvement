Tahesha Way, Lt. Governor and Secretary of State New Exhibition Explores Importance and Uses of Tree Bark Trenton, NJ - The New Jersey State Museum presents “Bark! Indigenous Cultural Expressions,” on view May 4, 2024 through January 5, 2025 in the Museum’s Riverside Gallery on the second floor. The exhibition features objects from the Museum’s Ethnographic collection, exploring indigenous cultural practices from the Pacific Northwest, South America, Pacific Islands, and the local Eastern Woodlands area. Learn how bark is harvested and crafted, and how these ancient traditions continue today. The exhibition is supported in part by the New Jersey State Museum Foundation. Assistant Curator of Archaeology and Ethnography Karen Flinn and Curator of Education Beth Cooper organized the exhibition to present rarely seen objects from the Museum’s collection and help visitors understand the importance of bark to indigenous populations. According to Flinn, “The use of tree bark is global and ubiquitous, from prehistoric times to today. Indigenous communities all over the world harvest bark, using it as a source of food and medicine, to craft everyday objects and works of art.” Activities for all ages will be available on select weekends throughout the run of the exhibit; dates and times will be posted on the Museum’s website. The text of this exhibition will be available in Spanish via a QR code and in a large print format. The New Jersey State Museum is open Tuesday - Sunday, 9:00 am to 4:45 pm; closed on all State holidays. General admission is free.
