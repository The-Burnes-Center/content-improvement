Tahesha Way, Lt. Governor and Secretary of State Grants for Traditional Folk Artists Available State Arts Council Announces Grant Opportunity and Application Workshops TRENTON, NJ – The New Jersey State Council on the Arts announces the availability of guidelines and applications for its Fiscal Year 2013 Folk Arts Apprenticeship Program. The application deadline is April 4, 2012 and free workshops conducted by Arts Council staff will be offered in various locations around the state for individuals and teams seeking assistance with the application process. (See schedule below). Folk Arts Apprenticeship grants support the traditional arts and crafts of New Jersey's many different cultural communities, helping talented apprentice artists further hone their skills by working directly with a master artist of a shared community. "The Council has long recognized the importance of supporting these unique customs and the artists who ensure they get passed forward authentically and consistently," said Arts Council Chair Ofelia Garcia. "Sustaining cultural traditions that have been practiced here and around the world for generations has wide-spread positive impact on New Jersey communities helping to strengthen group ties and promote cross-cultural understanding." Over the last 15 years, the Council's Folk Arts Apprenticeship Program has assisted hundreds of artists who make up a fascinating spectrum of traditional arts and crafts. Some of these apprenticeships have included art forms from the Filipino, Native American, Ukrainian, NJ Pinelands region, Japanese, African American, Puerto Rican and many other cultures and communities. Apprentices may request up to $3,000 to support an intensive regimen of study with a master artist for up to 12 months. The application process requires that each interested folk arts apprentice apply with a master artist as a team by providing artistic work samples, comprehensive, detailed information of their shared artistic cultural backgrounds and their planned scope of work together.
