Call to Action We, the Commissioners of the New Jersey Martin Luther King Commemorative Commission, denounce the senseless murders of George Floyd; Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade, and countless other African Americans who for too long have been the victims of institutionalized racial injustice in this country. In his book Why We Can’t Wait , Dr. King wrote “Three hundred years of humiliation, abuse and deprivation cannot be expected to find voice in a whisper.” We decry the effects of systemic racial discrimination, not with a whisper, but with a thunderous outcry that we will match with renewed vigilance and purposeful and powerful actions. Each year, the Commission, the first such State Commission in the Nation, recalls historical events in the life of Dr. King and the Civil Rights Movement, while focusing on issues of current import. We have commemorated the Montgomery Bus Boycott, Jackie Robinson breaking the color line in baseball, and “Women Who Led” in the struggle for civil rights. This year, we have chosen the theme: “Youth, We Hear You,” recognizing the emerging voices of a new generation. We will host a Youth Town Hall in the Fall, and our annual Commemorative on January 17, 2021, which will be followed by a statewide virtual Youth Conference and Day of Service on January 18, 2021. In the face of the recent historically deplorable events, and the extraordinary moment that they offer, the Commission plans to develop an agenda focused on key issues that provide both challenges and opportunities for progress. We believe that New Jersey can be a role model to finally recognize the fullest manifestation of democracy in this country. This vision calls for policies that guarantee equal protection under the law; that promise that race and poverty will no longer be death sentences; and an end to mass incarceration. We call for eliminating deadly force police protocols, de-militarized policing, developing a comprehensive plan to end school desegregation, and exploring ideas that are being studied related to reparative justice. We also call for appropriate funding for counseling services for students to address bullying and racial discrimination. We will make our agenda known throughout the state and will invite groups and individuals, of all ages and backgrounds, to join us in achieving these objectives. We will also highlight the ongoing work of organizations throughout New Jersey and provide a platform for them to share our mutual commitment and goals. As we recognize Dr. King’s call to action in the “fierce urgency of now,” we call upon everyone to become involved, to join us in partnership, and to go from strength to strength together. Please join us! Resources on the History of Slavery in New Jersey It has been 400 years since the first arrival in English-occupied North America of enslaved people from Africa. To mark this anniversary, the Commission is highlighting resources related to the history of slavery in New Jersey.
