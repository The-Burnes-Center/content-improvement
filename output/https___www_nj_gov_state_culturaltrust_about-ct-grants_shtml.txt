Tahesha Way, Lt. Governor and Secretary of State About Cultural Trust Grants The Cultural Trust’s grant programs further the Trust’s mission of ensuring a stable and healthy nonprofit cultural industry in New Jersey by supporting projects that build organizations’ financial and institutional stability and capacity, and by funding important capital projects. The Cultural Trust offers three different grant programs: Institutional and Financial Stabilization Grants for Arts Organizations(IFS Arts) Institutional and Financial Stabilization Grants for History/Humanities Organizations(IFS History/Humanities) Capital Historic Preservation Grants for Arts, History, and Humanities Organizations(Capital Historic Preservation) Typically, one grant program is offered each fiscal year in the following rotation: Year 1: IFS Arts Year 2: IFS History/Humanities Year 3: IFS Arts Year 4: Capital Historic Preservation All Cultural Trust grants are one-year-long project-based grants. No match is required for any of the Cultural Trust’s grant programs. In order to be eligible for any Cultural Trust grant program, an organization must first be designated qualified by the Cultural Trust. Learn more about qualification . In each program, the guidelines and application are developed by one of the Cultural Trust’s recommending agencies. The recommending agency accepts applications and oversees the independent panel review process, then determines which applications should be recommended to receive Cultural Trust funding. These recommendations are submitted to the Cultural Trust Board for final approval. IFS Arts Institutional and Financial Stabilization Grants for Arts Organizations address the financial and institutional challenges that threaten nonprofit arts organizations’ stability and help them build greater operational capacity to manage and advance their work. Grants are available within the following categories: Establishing, replenishing or growing a working capital fund/cash reserve Debt/deficit reduction Strategic planning/assessment Technology upgrade Capital equipment purchase Professional development for staff/board New staff position The New Jersey State Council on the Arts serves as the recommending agency for the IFS Arts program. IFS History/Humanities Institutional and Financial Stabilization Grants for History/Humanities Organizations support very similar projects to the IFS Arts program, but for New Jersey’s nonprofit history and humanities organizations. Grants are available in the same categories listed above for IFS Arts grants. The New Jersey Historical Commission serves as the recommending agency for the IFS History/Humanities program. Capital Historic Preservation Capital Historic Preservation grants support capital projects at historic sites, and are open to New Jersey nonprofit arts, history, and humanities organizations. Eligible sites must be listed on the New Jersey and/or National Register of Historic Places, or contribute to the significance of a historic district listed on the New Jersey and/or National Register of Historic Places.
