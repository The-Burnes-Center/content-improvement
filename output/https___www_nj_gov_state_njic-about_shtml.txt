Tahesha Way, Secretary of State About the Commission The mission of the New Jersey-Israel Commission is to foster economic, scientific, educational and cultural ties with the State of Israel, one of New Jersey's most important trading partners. History In 1988, under Governor Thomas H. Kean, a Sister State Agreement was signed between the State of Israel and the State of New Jersey. The New Jersey-Israel Commission was established in 1989 to implement the goals of this agreement - to promote the development of trade, culture and educational exchanges; encourage the development of capital investment and joint business ventures; and foster a spirit of cooperation between the citizens of the State of Israel and the State of New Jersey. The New Jersey-Israel Commission was placed under the purview of the Department of State in July, 2007. Prior to this, the Commission came under the New Jersey Commerce, Economic Development & Tourism Commission (which is now the New Jersey Commerce Commission).
