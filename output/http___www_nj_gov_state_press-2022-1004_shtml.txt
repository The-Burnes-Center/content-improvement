At Polling Place on Election Day 2. In-Person Early Voting 3. Vote By Mail Ballot “It is important for voters to get their information from trusted sources, such as the Vote.NJ.Gov website, and understand the three convenient ways available to cast their ballot,” said New Jersey Secretary of State Tahesha Way. “We’ve made it easy on the website to find your polling location or a county early voting site, find secure ballot dropboxes, and more.” 1. At Local Polling Place on Election Day Registered voters can cast their ballot in person at their polling place, from 6:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. on Election Day, November 8. Accommodations will be made for voters with disabilities. Go to VOTE.NJ.GOV for polling places, listed on the Polling Locations page. 2. In-Person Early Voting This option enables all registered voters to cast their ballot in person, using a voting machine, during a nine-day period prior to Election Day. Voters can choose to vote, in person, when it’s most convenient for their schedule. No matter where a voter lives in their county, they can cast their specific ballot at any of their county’s designated in-person early voting locations. County locations can be found at VOTE.NJ.GOV . In-person early voting locations will be open Saturday, October 29 through Sunday, November 6. Hours will be Monday – Saturday, 10:00 a.m. - 8:00 p.m. and Sunday 10:00 a.m. – 6:00 p.m. No appointment is necessary. Accommodations will be made for voters with disabilities. 3. Vote By Mail Ballot Registered voters can apply for a vote by mail ballot by following the instructions found at VOTE.NJ.GOV or contacting their County Clerk. Returning a vote by mail ballot is once again as easy as VOTE, SIGN, SEAL, RETURN. Return options include: Mail: It must be postmarked on or before 8 p.m. November 8 and received by their county Board of Elections on or before November 14. Secure Ballot Drop Box: Place the ballot in one of their county’s secure ballot drop boxes by 8 p.m. November 8. Drop box locations can be found at VOTE.NJ.GOV . Board of Elections Office: Deliver the ballot in person to the county Board of Elections office by 8 p.m. November 8. County Election Officials contact information can be found at VOTE.NJ.GOV .
