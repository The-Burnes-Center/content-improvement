Tahesha Way, Lt. Governor and Secretary of State New Jersey Cultural Trust Approves Nearly $300,000 in FY 2016 Institutional and Financial Stabilization Grants Funding to Strengthen Organizational Capacity of 15 History and Humanities Organizations Statewide LAMBERTVILLE, N.J. – Furthering the Christie Administration’s ongoing commitment to strengthening the state’s cultural and historic legacy for future generations, the board of the New Jersey Cultural Trust has approved over $297,000 in FY 2016 Institutional and Financial Stabilization Grants to 15 history and humanities organizations statewide. The annual grant meeting took place at the renowned Roxey Ballet in Lambertville. “The work of the New Jersey Cultural Trust is vital to maintaining the financial stability of the state’s countless history, arts, and cultural resources,” said Lt. Governor Kim Guadagno, who serves concurrently as Secretary of State and oversees the Cultural Trust operations. “This critical funding will not only serve to support the operational capacity of history organizations, but in doing so provide opportunities to dedicate critical funds to expand their essential mission and programming to both traditional and new audiences.” Unique among the other grant programs within the Department of State, Cultural Trust grant funding is not the result of a direct budget appropriation, but rather derives from the interest earnings accrued annually by the Trust Fund, which was created by the Cultural Trust Act of 2000. The purpose of the legislation was to provide an additional, permanent funding source for arts, history, and cultural institutions, with the responsibility for grant recommendations to the Cultural Trust board rotating annually between the New Jersey Historical Commission, New Jersey Historic Trust, and the New Jersey State Council on the Arts. For FY 2016, recommendations were made by the New Jersey Historical Commission to promote the financial stabilization of qualified history and humanities organizations. Eligible projects for consideration included proposals for deficit reduction, capacity building, establishing working capital, strategic planning, professional development, and technological advancements, among others. New Jersey Cultural Trust grant recommendations and awards are determined through an independent, third-party review process by qualified persons employing uniform evaluation criteria.
