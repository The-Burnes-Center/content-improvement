Tahesha Way, Lt. Governor and Secretary of State New Jersey Historical Commission Board Approves $5.2 million in Statewide Fiscal Year 2025 General Operating Support, Project, Co-Sponsored Project, and County History Partnership Program Grant Support Funding will Support History Organizations, Projects, and Programs across all 21 Counties TRENTON, NJ – The New Jersey Historical Commission (NJHC) has announced its Fiscal Year 2025 (FY2025) grant recipients encompassing an array of programs to support historical organizations, museums, historic sites, archives, individuals, and county re-grant agencies across the state. The $5.2 million in will support the NJHC’s General Operating Support (GOS) program, which covers a range of operational expenses for qualified history organizations; Projects and Co-Sponsored Projects, which includes New Jersey-based historical research, exhibits, programs, and archival work; and the County History Partnership Program (CHPP), which provides all 21 counties with funding for local history groups statewide. “History education and programming are essential to nurturing a lifetime of learning and civic engagement,” noted Lt. Governor Tahesha Way, who oversees the NJHC in her role as Secretary of State. “This funding will ensure history groups have the resources to not only strengthen and advance existing research, planning, and programming, but also supports their preparations for the upcoming commemoration of America’s 250th.” The annual return on investment for NJHC grant funding tells the story. In Fiscal Year 2023, the 44 history organizations across the state that received $2.9 million in General Operating Support (GOS) funding alone leveraged $34 million in overall matching dollars, $27 million in total spending, offered on-and-off-site programs to more than 1.8 million visitors, hosted nearly 11 million website visitors, and supported approximately 600 full and part-time jobs statewide. Add to this the profound impacts of the growing NJHC portfolio of other grant programs, and it is easy to see the extraordinary extent and importance this funding has to the people of New Jersey. “Expanding the reach of NJHC initiatives and maximizing every dollar will continue to be priorities in FY2025,” said Sara Cureton, Executive Director of the New Jersey Historical Commission. “This is not only true for our traditional GOS and project-related programs, but for newer initiatives such as the Inclusive History Grant Program and the New Jersey Black Heritage Trail as well. It also entails forging thriving collaborations like RevolutionNJ ahead of the 250th in 2026 and other efforts to embrace new and existing statewide history partnerships.” For more information on the NJHC’s grant programs, African American History Program, and all other initiatives, visit: History.NJ.gov .

All funding is made possible by a portion of the revenue produced by the state’s Hotel/Motel Tax legislation.
