How do you take a galaxy and turn it into sound? Sonification is the mapping of data to sounds, and through sonification we can transform galaxy data into tones that we can hear. These sounds capture the patterns that can be seen with our eyes and tell us about the structure of the galaxy. In this lecture, we will listen to galaxy data and discover how sonification works. We will also learn how scientists are using the tools and techniques underlying these sonifications to gain new insight into how galaxies evolve in time. Reserve your seat.
