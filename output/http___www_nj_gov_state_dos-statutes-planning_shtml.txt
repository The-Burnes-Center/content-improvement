Intergovernmental Agreement Intergovernmental Agreement - Lt. Governor Kim Guadagno Intergovernmental Agreement Between the New Jersey Department of State and the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs Reorganization Plan Reorganization Plan #002-2011 - Governor Chris Christie A Plan for the Transfer of the State Planning Commission and the Office of Smart Growth and their Functions, Powers, and Duties from the Department of Community Affairs to the Department of State NJSA 52:18A-196 Findings, declarations 1. The Legislature finds and declares that: a. New Jersey, the nation's most densely populated State, requires sound and integrated Statewide planning and the coordination of Statewide planning with local and regional planning in order to conserve its natural resources, revitalize its urban centers, protect the quality of its environment, and provide needed housing and adequate public services at a reasonable cost while promoting beneficial economic growth, development and renewal; b. Significant economies, efficiencies and savings in the development process would be realized by private sector enterprise and by public sector development agencies if the several levels of government would cooperate in the preparation of and adherence to sound and integrated plans; c. It is of urgent importance that the State Development Guide Plan be replaced by a State Development and Redevelopment Plan designed for use as a tool for assessing suitable locations for infrastructure, housing, economic growth and conservation; d. It is in the public interest to encourage development, redevelopment and economic growth in locations that are well situated with respect to present or anticipated public services and facilities, giving appropriate priority to the redevelopment, repair, rehabilitation or replacement of existing facilities and to discourage development where it may impair or destroy natural resources or environmental qualities that are vital to the health and well-being of the present and future citizens of this State; e. A cooperative planning process that involves the full participation of State, regional, county and local governments as well as other public and private sector interests will enhance prudent and rational development, redevelopment and conservation policies and the formulation of sound and consistent regional plans and planning criteria; f. Since the overwhelming majority of New Jersey land use planning and development review occurs at the local level, it is important to provide local governments in this State with the technical resources and guidance necessary to assist them in developing land use plans and procedures which are based on sound planning information and practice, and to facilitate the development of local plans which are consistent with State and regional plans and programs; g. An increasing concentration of the poor and minorities in older urban areas jeopardizes the future well-being of this State, and a sound and comprehensive planning process will facilitate the provision of equal social and economic opportunity so that all of New Jersey's citizens can benefit from growth, development and redevelopment; h. An adequate response to judicial mandates respecting housing for low- and moderate-income persons requires sound planning to prevent sprawl and to promote suitable use of land; and i. These purposes can be best achieved through the establishment of a State planning commission consisting of representatives from the executive and legislative branches of State government, local government, the general public and the planning community. L.1985,c.398,s.1; amended 2004, c.120, s.63. NJSA 52:18A-197 State Planning Commission There is established in the Department of the Treasury a State Planning Commission, to consist of 17 members to be appointed as follows: a.

Take all actions necessary and proper to carry out the provisions of P.L.1985, c.398 (C.52:18A-196 et al.). L.1985,c.398,s.4; amended 1987, c.308; 2004, c.120, s.64. NJSA 52:18A-200 State Development and Redevelopment Plan 5.The State Development and Redevelopment Plan shall be designed to represent a balance of development and conservation objectives best suited to meet the needs of the State. The plan shall: a. Protect the natural resources and qualities of the State, including, but not limited to, agricultural development areas, fresh and saltwater wetlands, flood plains, stream corridors, aquifer recharge areas, steep slopes, areas of unique flora and fauna, and areas with scenic, historic, cultural and recreational values; b. Promote development and redevelopment in a manner consistent with sound planning and where infrastructure can be provided at private expense or with reasonable expenditures of public funds.

L.1985,c.398,s.5; amended 2004, c.120, s.65. NJSA 52:18A-201 Office of State Planning 6. a. There is established in the Department of the Treasury the Office of State Planning. The director of the office shall be appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the Governor. The director shall supervise and direct the activities of the office and shall serve as the secretary and principal executive officer of the State Planning Commission. b. The Office of State Planning shall assist the commission in the performance of its duties and shall: (1) Publish an annual report on the status of the State Development and Redevelopment Plan which shall describe the progress towards achieving the goals of the plan, the degree of consistency achieved among municipal, county, regional, and State plans, the capital needs of the State, and progress towards providing housing where such need is indicated; (2) Provide planning service to other agencies or instrumentalities of State government, review the plans prepared by them, and coordinate planning to avoid or mitigate conflicts between plans; (3) Provide advice and assistance to regional, county and local planning units; (4) Review and comment on the plans of interstate agencies where the plans affect this State; (5) Compile quantitative current estimates and Statewide forecasts for population, employment, housing and land needs for development and redevelopment; and (6) Prepare and submit to the State Planning Commission, as an aid in the preparation of the State Development and Redevelopment Plan, alternate growth and development strategies which are likely to produce favorable economic, environmental and social results. c. The director shall ensure that the responsibilities and duties of the commission are fulfilled, and shall represent the commission and promote its activities before government agencies, public and private interest groups and the general public, and shall undertake or direct such other activities as the commission shall direct or as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of P.L.1985, c.398 (C.52:18A-196 et al.). d. With the consent of the commission, the director shall assign to the commission from the staff of the office at least two full-time planners, a full-time liaison to local and county governments and regional entities, and such other staff, clerical, stenographic and expert assistance as the director shall deem necessary for the fulfillment of the commission's responsibilities and duties. L.1985,c.398,s.6; amended 2004, c.120, s.66. NJSA 52:18A-201.1 "Military facility," "military facility commander," notification of land use plan 5. a. As used in this section: "military facility" means any facility located within the State which is owned or operated by the federal government, and which is used for the purposes of providing logistical, technical, material, training, and any other support to any branch of the United States military; and "military facility commander" means the chief official, base commander or person in charge at a military facility. b. Whenever any State department, office, agency, authority, or commission proposes a plan that would impact the use of land within 3,000 feet in all directions of any military facility, it shall notify the Director of the Office of State Planning in the Department of Community Affairs prior to finalizing its plan. The director shall contact the appropriate military facility commander in order to solicit comments addressing any land use compatibility issues which may be of concern to the military and shall forward those comments to the appropriate State department, office, agency, authority, or commission. The State department, office, agency, authority, or commission shall not finalize its plan until it has reviewed any comments submitted by the military facility commander on its proposed plan. c. The Adjutant General of the Department of Military and Veterans' Affairs shall, within 30 days of the effective date of P.L.2005, c.41 (C.40:55D-12.4 et al.), forward a list of military facilities to the Director of the Office of State Planning. The director shall circulate the list to each State department, office, agency, authority or commission. d. The Director of the Office of State Planning, upon receiving the list of military facilities from the Adjutant General, shall forthwith notify those municipalities and State departments, offices, agencies, authorities and commissions of the requirements of this section. L.2005,c.41,s.5. NJSA 52:18A-202 Advice of other entities; plan cross-acceptance 7. a. In preparing, maintaining and revising the State Development and Redevelopment Plan, the commission shall solicit and give due consideration to the plans, comments and advice of each county and municipality, State agencies designated by the commission, the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Council established pursuant to section 4 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-4), and other local and regional entities. Prior to the adoption of each plan, the commission shall prepare and distribute a preliminary plan to each county planning board, municipal planning board and other requesting parties, including State agencies, the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Council, and metropolitan planning organizations. Not less than 45 nor more than 90 days thereafter, the commission shall conduct a joint public informational meeting with each county planning board in each county and with the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Council for the purpose of providing information on the plan, responding to inquiries concerning the plan, and receiving informal comments and recommendations from county and municipal planning boards, local public officials, the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Council, and other interested parties. b. The commission shall negotiate plan cross-acceptance with each county planning board, which shall solicit and receive any findings, recommendations and objections concerning the plan from local planning bodies. Each county planning board shall negotiate plan cross-acceptance among the local planning bodies within the county, unless it shall notify the commission in writing within 45 days of the receipt of the preliminary plan that it waives this responsibility, in which case the commission shall designate an appropriate entity, or itself, to assume this responsibility. Each board or designated entity shall, within ten months of receipt of the preliminary plan, file with the commission a formal report of findings, recommendations and objections concerning the plan, including a description of the degree of consistency and any remaining inconsistency between the preliminary plan and county and municipal plans. In any event, should any municipality's plan remain inconsistent with the State Development and Redevelopment Plan after the completion of the cross-acceptance process, the municipality may file its own report with the State Planning Commission, notwithstanding the fact that the county planning board has filed its report with the State Planning Commission. The term cross-acceptance means a process of comparison of planning policies among governmental levels with the purpose of attaining compatibility between local, county, regional, and State plans. The process is designed to result in a written statement specifying areas of agreement or disagreement and areas requiring modification by parties to the cross-acceptance. c. Upon consideration of the formal reports of the county planning boards, the commission shall prepare and distribute a final plan to county and municipal planning boards, the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Council, and other interested parties. The commission shall conduct not less than six public hearings in different locations throughout the State for the purpose of receiving comments on the final plan. The commission shall give at least 30 days' public notice of each hearing in advertisements in at least two newspapers which circulate in the area served by the hearing and at least 30 days' notice to the governing body and planning board of each county and municipality in the area served by the hearing and to the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Council for any area in the Highlands Region served by the hearing. d. Taking full account of the testimony presented at the public hearings, the commission shall make revisions in the plan as it deems necessary and appropriate and adopt the final plan by a majority vote of its authorized membership no later than 60 days after the final public hearing. L.1985,c.398,s.7; amended 1998, c.109, s.1; 2004, c.120, s.67. NJSA 52:18A-202a Extended period for filing report on preliminary plan 2.The extended period for the filing of a formal report of findings, recommendations and objections concerning the preliminary plan provided for in section 7 of P.L.1985, c.398 (C.52:18A-202), as amended by P.L.1998, c.109, shall apply to any preliminary plan which has not been finalized by the commission, as provided in subsection c. of section 7 of P.L.1985, c.398 (C.52:18A-202) prior to the effective date of P.L.1998, c.109. L.1998,c.109,s.2. NJSA 52:18A-202.1 Findings, declarations The Legislature finds and declares that: a. There are many concerns associated with the design and implementation of the State Development and Redevelopment Plan (hereafter referred to as the "Plan"), including: (1) maintaining beneficial growth; (2) improving environmental quality; (3) assuring cost-effective delivery of infrastructure and other public services; (4) improving intergovernmental coordination; (5) preserving the quality of community life; and (6) redeveloping the State's major urban areas. b. Each of these concerns is an important issue for further study and each should serve as a measure of the efficacy of the Plan. c. However, these concerns are not mutually exclusive and, therefore, a balance among them must be achieved to maximize the well-being for the State and its residents. d. The process of cross-acceptance of the State Development and Redevelopment Plan required under the "State Planning Act," P.L.1985, c.398 (C.52:18A-196 et seq.), is a process designed to elicit the greatest degree of public participation in order to encourage the development of a consensus among the many, sometimes competing, interests in the State. e. This consensus will be facilitated by the availability of sufficient information concerning the impact the State Development and Redevelopment Plan may have on particular regions and on the overall economic well-being of the State. f. The Plan evolves through three phases: (1) the Preliminary Plan, which will serve as the basis for cross-acceptance; (2) the Interim Plan, which will reflect the changes occurring during the cross-acceptance process; and (3) the Final Plan, which is to be implemented after approval by the State Planning Commission. g. A two-stage process shall be established to examine the economic, environmental, infrastructure, community life, and intergovernmental coordination impacts of the Plan. This procedure shall consist of an assessment of the impacts of the Interim Plan and an on-going monitoring and evaluation program after the Final Plan is adopted. h. The results of the Assessment Study shall identify desirable changes to be incorporated into the Final Plan. These studies shall describe the impacts of the policies and strategies proposed in the Plan (hereafter referred to as the "Plan" impacts) relative to the impacts that would likely occur without a Plan (hereafter referred to as "Trend" impacts). In examining the impacts of Plan and Trend, any significant regional differences that result shall be identified and analyzed. Where appropriate, the study shall also distinguish short-term and long-term impacts. i. It is necessary to conduct an economic assessment of the Plan and Trend impacts and to make the results of that assessment available before adoption of the Final Plan. Work on the development of the evaluation methodology and, where possible, the collection of data for the assessment study shall commence upon enactment of this bill. Some factors that shall be addressed during cross-acceptance include: (1) Changes in property values, including farmland, State and local expenditures and tax revenues, and regulations; (2) Changes in housing supply, housing prices, employment, population and income; (3) Costs of providing the infrastructure systems identified in the State Planning Act; (4) Costs of preserving the natural resources as identified in the State Planning Act; (5) Changes in business climate; and (6) Changes in the agricultural industry and the costs of preserving farmland and open spaces. L.1989, c.332, s.1. NJSA 52:18A-202.2 Studies; review 2. a. The Office of State Planning in consultation with the Office of Economic Policy, shall utilize the following: (1) Conduct portions of these studies using its own staff; (2) Contract with other State agencies to conduct portions of these studies; and (3) Contract with an independent firm or an institution of higher learning to conduct portions of these studies. b. Any portion of the studies conducted by the Office of State Planning, or any other State agency, shall be subject to review by an independent firm or an institution of higher learning. c. The Assessment Study and the oversight review shall be submitted in the form of a written report to the State Planning Commission for distribution to the Governor, the Legislature, appropriate regional entities, and the governing bodies of each county and municipality in the State during the cross-acceptance process and prior to the adoption of the Final Plan. d. A period extending from at least 45 days prior to the first of six public hearings, which are required under the State Planning Act, P.L.1985, c.398 (C.52:18A-196 et seq.), to 30 days following the last public hearing shall be provided for counties and municipalities to review and respond to the studies. Requests for revisions to the Interim Plan shall be considered by the State Planning Commission in the formulation of the Final Plan. L.1989,c.332,s.2; amended 2004, c.120, s.68.

The Final Plan shall include the appropriate monitoring variables and plan targets in the economic, environmental, infrastructure, community life, and intergovernmental coordination areas to be evaluated on an on-going basis following adoption of the Final Plan. b. In implementing the monitoring and evaluation program, if Plan targets are not being realized, the State Planning Commission shall evaluate reasons for the occurrences and determine if changes in Plan targets or policies are warranted. c. The Office of State Planning shall include in its annual report results of the on-going monitoring and evaluation program and forward the report to the Governor and the Legislature. L.1989, c.332, s.3. NJSA 52:18A-203 Rules, regulations 8. a. The commission shall adopt rules and regulations to carry out its purposes, including procedures to facilitate the solicitation and receipt of comments in the preparation of the preliminary and final plan and to ensure a process for comparison of the plan with county and municipal master plans and regional plans, and procedures for coordinating the information collection, storage and retrieval activities of the various State agencies, and to establish a process for the endorsement of municipal, county, and regional plans that are consistent with the State Development and Redevelopment Plan. b. Any municipality or county or portion thereof located in the Highlands preservation area as defined in section 3 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-3) shall be exempt from the plan endorsement process established in the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to subsection a. of this section.

Sections 23 through 43 and section 45 of P.L.1993, c.139 (C.58:10B-1 et seq.), as may be amended and supplemented, shall be known and may be cited as the "Brownfield and Contaminated Site Remediation Act." L.1997,c.278,s.1. NJSA 58:10B-1.2 Findings, declarations relative to remediation of contaminated sites 2. The Legislature finds and declares that due to New Jersey's industrial history, large areas in the State's urban and suburban areas formerly used for commercial and industrial purposes are underused or abandoned; that many of these properties, often referred to as brownfields, are contaminated with hazardous substances and pose a health risk to the nearby residents and a threat to the environment; and that these sites can be a blight to the neighborhood and a financial drain on a municipality because they have no productive use, and fail to generate property taxes and jobs. The Legislature further finds that often there are legal, financial, technical, and institutional impediments to the efficient and cost-effective cleanup of brownfield sites as well as all other contaminated sites wherever they may be. The Legislature finds and declares that the State needs to ensure that the public health and safety and the environment are protected from the risks posed by contaminated sites and that strict standards coupled with a risk based and flexible regulatory system will result in more cleanups and thus the elimination of the public's exposure to these hazardous substances and the environmental degradation that contamination causes. The Legislature therefore declares that strict remediation standards are necessary to protect public health and safety and the environment; that these standards should be adopted based upon the risk posed by discharged hazardous substances; that unrestricted remedies for contaminated sites are preferable and the State must adopt policies that encourage their use; that institutional and engineering controls should be allowed only when the public health risk and environmental protection standards are met; and that in order to encourage the cleanup of contaminated sites, there must be finality in the process, the provision of financial incentives, liability protection for innocent parties who clean up, cleanup procedures that are cost effective and regulatory action that is timely and efficient. 1.Sections 23 through 43 and section 45 of P.L.1993, c.139 (C.58:10B-1 et seq.), as may be amended and supplemented, shall be known and may be cited as the "Brownfield and Contaminated Site Remediation Act."

The documents for the preliminary assessment, site investigation, remedial investigation, and remedial action workplan required to be submitted for a remediation, shall not be identical to the criteria and standards used for similar documents submitted pursuant to federal law, except as may be required by federal law. In establishing criteria and standards for these terms the department shall strive to be result oriented, provide for flexibility, and to avoid duplicate or unnecessarily costly or time consuming conditions or standards. b. The regulations adopted by the department pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall provide that a person performing a remediation may deviate from the strict adherence to the regulations, in a variance procedure or by another method prescribed by the department, if that person can demonstrate that the deviation and the resulting remediation would be as protective of human health, safety, and the environment, as appropriate, as the department's regulations and that the health risk standards established in subsection d. of section 35 of P.L.1993, c.139 (C.58:10B-12) and any applicable environmental standards would be met. Factors to be considered in determining if the deviation should be allowed are whether the alternative method: (1) has been either used successfully or approved by the department in writing or similar situations; (2) reflects current technology as documented in peer-reviewed professional journals; (3) can be expected to achieve the same or substantially the same results or objectives as the method which it is to replace; and (4) furthers the attainment of the goals of the specific remedial phase for which it is used. c. To the extent practicable and in conformance with the standards for remediations as provided in section 35 of P.L.1993, c.139 (C.58:10-12), the department shall adopt rules and regulations that allow for certain remedial actions to be undertaken in a manner prescribed by the department without having to obtain prior approval from or submit detailed documentation to the department.

L.2002, c.37, s.1; amended 2009, c.60,s.42. NJSA 58:10B-3 Establishment, maintenance of remediation funding source 25. a. Except as otherwise provided in section 27 of P.L.2009, c.60 (C.58:10C-27), the owner or operator of an industrial establishment or any other person required to perform remediation activities pursuant to P.L.1983, c.330 (C.13:1K-6 et al.), or a discharger, a person in any way responsible for a hazardous substance, or a person otherwise liable for cleanup and removal costs pursuant to P.L.1976, c.141 (C.58:10-23.11 et seq.) who has been issued a directive or an order by a State agency, who has entered into an administrative consent order with a State agency, or who has been ordered by a court to clean up and remove a hazardous substance or hazardous waste discharge pursuant to P.L.1976, c.141 (C.58:10-23.11 et seq.), shall establish and maintain a remediation funding source in the amount necessary to pay the estimated cost of the required remediation. A person who voluntarily undertakes a remediation pursuant to a memorandum of agreement with the department, or without the department's oversight, or who performs a remediation in an environmental opportunity zone is not required to establish or maintain a remediation funding source. A person who uses an innovative technology or who, in a timely fashion, implements an unrestricted use remedial action or a limited restricted use remedial action for all or part of a remedial action is not required to establish a remediation funding source for the cost of the remediation involving the innovative technology or permanent remedy. A government entity, a person who undertakes a remediation at their primary or secondary residence, the owner or operator of a child care center licensed pursuant to P.L.1983, c.492 (C.30:5B-1 et seq.) who performs a remediation at the licensed child care center, or the person responsible for conducting a remediation at a public school or private school as defined in N.J.S.18A:1-1, or a charter school established pursuant to P.L.1995, c.426 (C.18A:36A-1 et seq.), shall not be required to establish or maintain a remediation funding source. A person required to establish a remediation funding source pursuant to this section shall provide to the department satisfactory documentation that the requirement has been met. The remediation funding source shall be established in an amount equal to or greater than the cost estimate of the implementation of the remediation (1) as approved by the department or as determined by the licensed site remediation professional, as applicable, in accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the department pursuant to section 29 of P.L.2009, c.60 (C.58:10C-29), (2) as provided in an administrative consent order or remediation agreement or remediation certification as required pursuant to subsection e. of section 4 of P.L.1983, c.330, (3) as stated in a departmental order or directive, or (4) as agreed to by a court, and shall be in effect for a term not less than the actual time necessary to perform the remediation at the site. Whenever the remediation cost estimate increases, the person required to establish the remediation funding source shall cause the amount of the remediation funding source to be increased to an amount at least equal to the new estimate. Whenever the remediation cost estimate decreases, the person required to obtain the remediation funding source may file a written request to the department to decrease the amount in the remediation funding source or may submit written documentation to the department certified by the licensed site remediation professional of the details of the decrease in the cost estimate, as applicable. The remediation funding source may be decreased to the amount of the new estimate upon written approval by the department delivered to the person who established the remediation funding source or upon submission of the certification by the licensed site remediation professional, as applicable. b. The person who established the remediation funding source may use the remediation funding source to pay for the actual cost of the remediation. The department may not require any other financial assurance by the person responsible for conducting the remediation other than that required in this section. In the case of a remediation performed pursuant to P.L.1983, c.330, the remediation funding source shall be established no more than 14 days after the approval by the department or the certification by the licensed site remediation professional of a remedial action workplan, upon approval of a remediation agreement pursuant to subsection e. of section 4 of P.L.1983, c.330 (C.13:1K-9), or upon submission of a remediation certification pursuant to subsection e. of P.L.1983, c.330, unless the department approves an extension. In the case of a remediation performed pursuant to P.L.1976, c.141, the remediation funding source shall be established as provided in an administrative consent order signed by the parties, as provided by a court, or as directed or ordered by the department. In the case of a remediation performed under the department's oversight pursuant to section 27 of P.L.2009, c.60 (C.58:10C-27), the remediation funding source shall be established at the time the person becomes subject to the department's oversight. The establishment of a remediation funding source for that part of the remediation funding source to be established by a grant or financial assistance from the remediation fund may be established for the purposes of this subsection by the application for a grant or financial assistance from the remediation fund and satisfactory evidence submitted to the department that the grant or financial assistance will be awarded. However, if the financial assistance or grant is denied or the department finds that the person responsible for establishing the remediation funding source did not take reasonable action to obtain the grant or financial assistance, the department shall require that the full amount of the remediation funding source be established within 14 days of the denial or finding. Except as provided in section 27 of P.L.2009, c.60 (C.58:10C-27), the remediation funding source shall be evidenced by the establishment and maintenance of (1) a remediation trust fund, (2) an environmental insurance policy, issued by an entity licensed by the Department of Banking and Insurance to transact business in the State of New Jersey, to fund the remediation, (3) a line of credit from a financial institution regulated pursuant to State or federal law and satisfactory to the department authorizing the person responsible for performing the remediation to borrow money, (4) a self-guarantee, or (5) a letter of credit from a financial institution regulated pursuant to State or federal law that guarantees the performance of the remediation by the person to the satisfaction of the department, or by any combination thereof. Where it can be demonstrated that a person cannot establish and maintain a remediation funding source for the full cost of the remediation by a method specified in this subsection, that person may establish the remediation funding source for all or a portion of the remediation, by securing financial assistance from the Hazardous Discharge Site Remediation Fund as provided in section 29 of P.L.1993, c.139 (C.58:10B-7). c. A remediation trust fund shall be established pursuant to the provisions of this subsection. An originally signed duplicate of the trust agreement shall be delivered to the department by certified mail within 14 days of receipt of notice from the department that the remedial action workplan or remediation agreement as provided in subsection e. of section 4 of P.L.1983, c.330 is approved, upon submission of a remediation certification to the department as provided in subsection e. of section 4 of P.L.1983, c.330, or as specified in an administrative consent order, civil order, or order of the department, as applicable. The remediation trust fund agreement shall conform to a model trust fund agreement as established by the department and shall be accompanied by a certification of acknowledgment that conforms to a model established by the department. The trustee shall be an entity which has the authority to act as a trustee and whose trust operations are regulated and examined by a federal or New Jersey agency. The trust fund agreement shall provide that the remediation trust fund may not be revoked or terminated by the person required to establish the remediation funding source or by the trustee without the written consent of the department. The trustee shall release to the person required to establish the remediation funding source, or to the department or transferee of the property, as appropriate, only those moneys as the department or the licensed site remediation professional authorizes, in writing, to be released. For any remediation subject to the oversight of the department pursuant to section 27 of P.L.2009, c.60 (C.58:10C-27), the person entitled to receive money from the remediation trust fund shall submit documentation to the department detailing the costs incurred or to be incurred as part of the remediation. Upon a determination by the department that the costs are consistent with the remediation of the site, the department shall, in writing, authorize a disbursement of moneys from the remediation trust fund in the amount of the documented costs. The department shall return the original remediation trust fund agreement to the trustee for termination after the person required to establish the remediation funding source substitutes an alternative remediation funding source as specified in this section or the department notifies the person that that person is no longer required to maintain a remediation funding source for remediation of the contaminated site. d. An environmental insurance policy shall be established pursuant to the provisions of this subsection. An originally signed duplicate of the insurance policy shall be delivered to the department by certified mail, overnight delivery, or personal service within 30 days of receipt of notice from the department that the remedial action workplan or remediation agreement, as provided in subsection e. of section 4 of P.L.1983, c.330, is approved, upon submission of a remediation certification to the department as provided in subsection e. of section 4 of P.L.1983, c.330, or as specified in an administrative consent order, civil order, or order of the department, as applicable. The insurance company shall release to the person required to establish the remediation funding source, or to the department or transferee of the property, as appropriate, only those moneys as the department or the licensed site remediation professional authorizes, in writing, to be released. The person entitled to receive money from the environmental insurance policy shall submit documentation to the department detailing the costs incurred or to be incurred as part of the remediation. e. A line of credit shall be established pursuant to the provisions of this subsection. A line of credit shall allow the person establishing it to borrow money up to a limit established in a written agreement in order to pay for the cost of the remediation for which the line of credit was established. An originally signed duplicate of the line of credit agreement shall be delivered to the department by certified mail, overnight delivery, or personal service within 14 days of receipt of notice from the department that the remedial action workplan or remediation agreement as provided in subsection e. of section 4 of P.L.1983, c.330 is approved, upon submission of a remediation certification pursuant to subsection e. of P.L.1983, c.330 or as specified in an administrative consent order, civil order, or order of the department, as applicable. The line of credit agreement shall conform to a model agreement as established by the department and shall be accompanied by a certification of acknowledgment that conforms to a model established by the department. The person or institution providing the line of credit shall release to the person required to establish the remediation funding source, or to the department or transferee of the property as appropriate, only those moneys as the department or the licensed site remediation professional authorizes, in writing, to be released. The person entitled to draw upon the line of credit shall submit documentation to the department detailing the costs incurred or to be incurred as part of the remediation. Upon a determination that the costs are consistent with the remediation of the site, the department shall, in writing, authorize a disbursement from the line of credit in the amount of the documented costs. The department shall return the original line of credit agreement to the person or institution providing the line of credit for termination after the person required to establish the remediation funding source substitutes an alternative remediation funding source as specified in this section, or after the department notifies the person that that person is no longer required to maintain a remediation funding source for remediation of the contaminated site. f. A person may self-guarantee a remediation funding source upon the submittal of documentation to the department demonstrating that the cost of the remediation as estimated in the remedial action workplan, in the remediation agreement as provided in subsection e. of section 4 of P.L.1983, c.330, in a remediation certification submitted pursuant to subsection e. of P.L.1983, c.330, in an administrative consent order, or as provided in a departmental or court order, would not exceed one-third of the tangible net worth of the person required to establish the remediation funding source, and that the person has a cash flow sufficient to assure the availability of sufficient moneys for the remediation during the time necessary for the remediation. Satisfactory documentation of a person's capacity to self-guarantee a remediation funding source shall consist of audited financial statements, in which the auditor expresses an unqualified opinion, that includes a statement of income and expenses or similar statement of that person and the balance sheet or similar statement of assets and liabilities as used by that person for the fiscal year of the person making the application that ended closest in time to the date of the self-guarantee application. In the case of a special purpose entity established specifically for the purpose of acquiring and redeveloping a contaminated site, and for which a statement of income and expenses is not available, the documentation shall include a statement of assets and liabilities certified by a certified public accountant. The self-guarantee application shall be certified as true to the best of the applicant's information, knowledge, and belief, by the chief financial, or similar officer or employee, or general partner, or principal of the person making the self-guarantee application. A person shall be deemed by the department to possess the required cash flow pursuant to this section if that person's gross receipts exceed its gross payments in that fiscal year in an amount at least equal to the estimated costs of completing the remedial action workplan schedule to be performed in the 12-month period following the date on which the application for self-guarantee is made. In the event that a self-guarantee is required for a period of more than one year, applications for a self-guarantee shall be renewed annually pursuant to this subsection for each successive year. The department may establish requirements and reporting obligations to ensure that the person proposing to self-guarantee a remediation funding source meets the criteria for self-guaranteeing prior to the initiation of remedial action and until completion of the remediation. g. (1) If the person required to establish the remediation funding source fails to perform the remediation as required, or fails to meet the mandatory remediation timeframes or expedited site specific timeframes established pursuant to section 28 of P.L.2009, c.60 (C.58:10C-28) for the performance of the remedial action, the department shall make a written determination of this fact. A copy of the determination by the department shall be delivered to the person required to establish the remediation funding source and, in the case of a remediation conducted pursuant to P.L.1983, c.330 (C.13:1K-6 et al.), to any transferee of the property. Following this written determination, the department may perform the remediation in place of the person required to establish the remediation funding source. In order to finance the cost of the remediation the department may make disbursements from the remediation funding source, or, if sufficient moneys are not available from those funds, from the remediation guarantee fund created pursuant to section 45 of P.L.1993, c.139 (C.58:10B-20). (2) The transferee of property subject to a remediation conducted pursuant to P.L.1983, c.330 (C.13:1K-6 et al.), may, at any time after the department's determination of nonperformance by the owner or operator required to establish the remediation funding source, petition the department, in writing, with a copy being sent to the owner and operator, for authority to perform the remediation at the industrial establishment. The department, upon a determination that the transferee is competent to do so, may grant that petition which shall authorize the transferee to perform the remediation as specified in an approved remedial action workplan, or to perform the activities as required in a remediation agreement, or as provided in a remediation certification, and to avail itself of the moneys in the remediation trust fund, letter of credit, or line of credit or to make claims upon the environmental insurance policy for these purposes. The petition of the transferee shall not be granted by the department if the owner or operator continues or begins to perform its obligations within 14 days of the petition being filed with the department. (3) After the department has begun to perform the remediation in the place of the person required to establish the remediation funding source or has granted the petition of the transferee to perform the remediation, the person required to establish the remediation funding source shall not be permitted by the department to continue its performance obligations except upon the agreement of the department or the transferee, as applicable, or except upon a determination by the department that the transferee is not adequately performing the remediation. h. A letter of credit shall be established pursuant to the provisions of this subsection. A letter of credit shall allow a person to guarantee the availability of funds up to a limit established in a written agreement in order to guarantee the payment of the cost of the remediation for which the letter of credit was established. An originally signed duplicate of the letter of credit agreement shall be delivered to the department by certified mail, overnight delivery, or personal service within 14 days of receipt of notice from the department that the remedial action workplan or remediation agreement as provided in subsection e. of section 4 of P.L.1983, c.330 (C.13:1K-9) is approved, upon submission of a remediation certification pursuant to subsection e. of P.L.1983, c.330, or as specified in an administrative consent order, civil order, or order of the department, as applicable. The letter of credit agreement shall conform to a model agreement as established by the department and shall be accompanied by a certification of acknowledgment that conforms to a model established by the department. The financial institution that provides the letter of credit shall release to the department or to a person authorized to perform the remediation pursuant to subsection g. of this section, only moneys authorized by the department, or the authorized licensed site remediation professional, in writing, to be released. The department shall return the original letter of credit to the financial institution providing the letter of credit for termination after the person required to establish the remediation funding source substitutes an alternative remediation funding source as authorized in this section, or after the department notifies the person that that person is no longer required to maintain a remediation funding source for the remediation of the contaminated site.

By February 1 of each year, the department shall issue a report to the Senate Environment Committee and to the Assembly Environment and Solid Waste Committee, or their successors, listing, for the prior calendar year, each person who owed the remediation funding source surcharge, the amount of the surcharge paid, and the total amount collected. L.1993, c.139, s.33; amended 1997, c.278, s.16; 2009, c.60, s.46. NJSA 58:10B-12 Adoption of remedial standards 35. a. The Department of Environmental Protection shall adopt minimum remediation standards for soil, groundwater, and surface water quality necessary for the remediation of contamination of real property. The remediation standards shall be developed to ensure that the potential for harm to public health and safety and to the environment is minimized to acceptable levels, taking into consideration the location, the surroundings, the intended use of the property, the potential exposure to the discharge, and the surrounding ambient conditions, whether naturally occurring or man-made. Until the minimum remediation standards for the protection of public health and safety as described herein are adopted, the department shall apply public health and safety remediation standards for contamination at a site on a case-by-case basis based upon the considerations and criteria enumerated in this section. The department may not require any person to perform an ecological evaluation of any area of concern that consists of an underground storage tank storing heating oil for on-site consumption in a one to four family residential building. b. In developing minimum remediation standards the department shall: (1) base the standards on generally accepted and peer reviewed scientific evidence or methodologies; (2) base the standards upon reasonable assumptions of exposure scenarios as to amounts of contaminants to which humans or other receptors will be exposed, when and where those exposures will occur, and the amount of that exposure; (3) avoid the use of redundant conservative assumptions. The department shall avoid the use of redundant conservative assumptions by the use of parameters that provide an adequate margin of safety and which avoid the use of unrealistic conservative exposure parameters and which guidelines make use of the guidance and regulations for exposure assessment developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the "Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980," 42 U.S.C. s.9601 et seq. and other statutory authorities as applicable; (4) where feasible, establish the remediation standards as numeric or narrative standards setting forth acceptable levels or concentrations for particular contaminants; and (5) consider and utilize, in the absence of other standards used or developed by the Department of Environmental Protection and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the toxicity factors, slope factors for carcinogens and reference doses for non-carcinogens from the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS). c. (1) The department shall develop residential and nonresidential soil remediation standards that are protective of public health and safety. For contaminants that are mobile and transportable to groundwater or surface water, the residential and nonresidential soil remediation standards shall be protective of groundwater and surface water. Residential soil remediation standards shall be set at levels or concentrations of contamination for real property based upon the use of that property for residential or similar uses and which will allow the unrestricted use of that property without the need of engineering devices or any institutional controls and without exceeding a health risk standard greater than that provided in subsection d. of this section. Nonresidential soil remediation standards shall be set at levels or concentrations of contaminants that recognize the lower likelihood of exposure to contamination on property that will not be used for residential or similar uses, which will allow for the unrestricted use of that property for nonresidential purposes, and that can be met without the need of engineering controls. Whenever real property is remediated to a nonresidential soil remediation standard, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (3) of subsection g. of this section, the department shall require, pursuant to section 36 of P.L.1993, c.139 (C.58:10B-13), that the use of the property be restricted to nonresidential or other uses compatible with the extent of the contamination of the soil and that access to that site be restricted in a manner compatible with the allowable use of that property. (2) The department may develop differential remediation standards for surface water or groundwater that take into account the current, planned, or potential use of that water in accordance with the "Clean Water Act" (33 U.S.C. s.1251 et seq.) and the "Water Pollution Control Act," P.L.1977, c.74 (C.58:10A-1 et seq.). d. The department shall develop minimum remediation standards for soil, groundwater, and surface water intended to be protective of public health and safety taking into account the provisions of this section. In developing these minimum health risk remediation standards the department shall identify the hazards posed by a contaminant to determine whether exposure to that contaminant can cause an increase in the incidence of an adverse health effect and whether the adverse health effect may occur in humans. The department shall set minimum soil remediation health risk standards for both residential and nonresidential uses that: (1) for human carcinogens, as categorized by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, will result in an additional cancer risk of one in one million; (2) for noncarcinogens, will limit the Hazard Index for any given effect to a value not exceeding one. The health risk standards established in this subsection are for any particular contaminant and not for the cumulative effects of more than one contaminant at a site. e. Remediation standards and other remediation requirements established pursuant to this section and regulations adopted pursuant thereto shall apply to remediation activities required pursuant to the "Spill Compensation and Control Act," P.L.1976, c.141 (C.58:10-23.11 et seq.), the "Water Pollution Control Act," P.L.1977, c.74 (C.58:10A-1 et seq.), P.L.1986, c.102 (C.58:10A-21 et seq.), the "Industrial Site Recovery Act," P.L.1983, c.330 (C.13:1K-6 et al.), the "Solid Waste Management Act," P.L.1970, c.39 (C.13:1E-1 et seq.), the "Comprehensive Regulated Medical Waste Management Act," sections 1 through 25 of P.L.1989, c.34 (C.13:1E-48.1 et seq.), the "Major Hazardous Waste Facilities Siting Act," P.L.1981, c.279 (C.13:1E-49 et seq.), the "Sanitary Landfill Facility Closure and Contingency Fund Act," P.L.1981, c.306 (C.13:1E-100 et seq.), the "Regional Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Facility Siting Act," P.L.1987, c.333 (C.13:1E-177 et seq.), or any other law or regulation by which the State may compel a person to perform remediation activities on contaminated property. However, nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the authority of the department to establish discharge limits for pollutants or to prescribe penalties for violations of those limits pursuant to P.L.1977, c.74 (C.58:10A-1 et seq.), or to require the complete removal of nonhazardous solid waste pursuant to law. f. (1) A person performing a remediation of contaminated real property, in lieu of using the established minimum soil remediation standard for either residential use or nonresidential use adopted by the department pursuant to subsection c. of this section, may submit to the department a request to use an alternative residential use or nonresidential use soil remediation standard. The use of an alternative soil remediation standard shall be based upon site specific factors which may include (1) physical site characteristics which may vary from those used by the department in the development of the soil remediation standards adopted pursuant to this section; or (2) a site specific risk assessment. If a person performing a remediation requests to use an alternative soil remediation standard based upon a site specific risk assessment, that person shall demonstrate to the department that the requested deviation from the risk assessment protocol used by the department in the development of soil remediation standards pursuant to this section is consistent with the guidance and regulations for exposure assessment developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the "Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980," 42 U.S.C.s.9601 et seq. and other statutory authorities as applicable. A site specific risk assessment may consider exposure scenarios and assumptions that take into account the form of the contaminant present, natural biodegradation, fate and transport of the contaminant, available toxicological data that are based upon generally accepted and peer reviewed scientific evidence or methodologies, and physical characteristics of the site, including, but not limited to, climatic conditions and topographic conditions. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize the use of an alternative soil remediation standard in those instances where an engineering control is the appropriate remedial action, as determined by the department, to prevent exposure to contamination. Upon a determination by the department that the requested alternative remediation standard satisfies the department's regulations, is protective of public health and safety, as established in subsection d. of this section, and is protective of the environment pursuant to subsection a. of this section, the alternative residential use or nonresidential use soil remediation standard shall be approved by the department. The burden to demonstrate that the requested alternative remediation standard is protective rests with the person requesting the alternative standard and the department may require the submission of any documentation as the department determines to be necessary in order for the person to meet that burden. (2) The department may, upon its own initiative, require an alternative remediation standard for a particular contaminant for a specific real property site, in lieu of using the established minimum residential use or nonresidential use soil remediation standard adopted by the department for a particular contaminant pursuant to this section. The department may require an alternative remediation standard pursuant to this paragraph upon a determination by the department, based on the weight of the scientific evidence, that due to specific physical site characteristics of the subject real property, including, but not limited to, its proximity to surface water, the use of the adopted residential use or nonresidential use soil remediation standards would not be protective, or would be unnecessarily overprotective, of public health or safety or of the environment, as appropriate. g. The development, selection, and implementation of any remediation standard or remedial action shall ensure that it is protective of public health, safety, and the environment, as applicable, as provided in this section. In determining the appropriate remediation standard or remedial action that shall occur at a site, the department and any person performing the remediation, shall base the decision on the following factors: (1) Unrestricted use remedial actions, limited restricted use remedial actions and restricted use remedial actions shall be allowed except that unrestricted use remedial actions and limited restricted use remedial actions shall be preferred over restricted use remedial actions. For any remediation initiated one year after the date of enactment of P.L.2009, c.60 (C.58:10C-1 et al.), the department shall require the use of an unrestricted use remedial action, or a presumptive remedy or an alternative remedy as provided in paragraph (10) of this subsection, at a site or area of concern where new construction is proposed for residential purposes, for use as a child care center licensed pursuant to P.L.1983, c.492 (C.30:5B-1 et seq.), or as a public school or private school as defined in N.J.S.18A:1-1, as a charter school established pursuant to P.L.1995, c.426 (C.18A:36A-1 et seq.), or where there will be a change in the use of the site to residential, child care, or public school, private school, or charter school purposes or another purpose that involves use by a sensitive population. For any remediation initiated on or after the date of enactment of P.L.2009, c.60 (C.58:10C-1 et al.), the department may require the use of an unrestricted use remedial action or a presumptive remedy as provided in guidelines adopted pursuant to paragraph (10) of this subsection for a site or area of concern that is to be used for residential, child care, or public school, private school, or charter school purposes or another purpose that involves use by a sensitive population. Except as provided in this subsection, and section 27 of P.L.2009, c.60 (C.58:10C-27), the department, however, may not disapprove the use of a restricted use remedial action or a limited restricted use remedial action so long as the selected remedial action meets the health risk standard established in subsection d. of this section, and where, as applicable, is protective of the environment. Except as provided in this subsection and section 27 of P.L.2009, c.60 (C.58:10C-27), the choice of the remedial action to be implemented shall be made by the person responsible for conducting the remediation in accordance with regulations adopted by the department and that choice of the remedial action shall be approved by the department if all the criteria for remedial action selection enumerated in this section, as applicable, are met. Except as provided in section 27 of P.L.2009, c.60 (C.58:10C-27), the department may not require a person to compare or investigate any alternative remedial action as part of its review of the selected remedial action. The department may disapprove the selection of a remedial action for a site on which the proposed remedial action will render the property unusable for future redevelopment or for recreational use; (2) Contamination may, upon the department's approval, be left onsite at levels or concentrations that exceed the minimum soil remediation standards for residential use if the implementation of institutional or engineering controls at that site will result in the protection of public health, safety and the environment at the health risk standard established in subsection d. of this section, if the requirements established in subsections a., b., c. and d. of section 36 of P.L.1993, c.139 (C.58:10B-13), and paragraphs (1) and (10) of this subsection, are met. The department may also require the treatment or removal of contaminated material that would pose an acute health or safety hazard in the event of failure of an engineering control; (3) Real property on which there is soil that has not been remediated to the residential soil remediation standards, or real property on which the soil, groundwater, or surface water has been remediated to meet the required health risk standard by the use of engineering or institutional controls, may be developed or used for residential purposes, or for any other similar purpose, if (a) all areas of that real property at which a person may come into contact with soil are remediated to meet the residential soil remediation standards, (b) it is clearly demonstrated that for all areas of the real property, other than those described in subparagraph (a) above, engineering and institutional controls can be implemented and maintained on the real property sufficient to meet the health risk standard as established in subsection d. of this section, and (c) a presumptive remedy established and approved by the department pursuant to paragraph (10) of this subsection, or an alternative remedy approved by the department pursuant to paragraph (10) of this subsection, has been approved, as provided in paragraphs (1) and (10) of this subsection; (4) Remediation shall not be required beyond the regional natural background levels for any particular contaminant. The department shall develop regulations that set forth a process to identify background levels of contaminants for a particular region. For the purpose of this paragraph "regional natural background levels" means the concentration of a contaminant consistently present in the environment of the region of the site and which has not been influenced by localized human activities; (5) Remediation shall not be required of the owner or operator of real property for contamination coming onto the site from another property owned and operated by another person, unless the owner or operator is the person who is liable for cleanup and removal costs pursuant to P.L.1976, c.141 (C.58:10-23.11 et seq.); (6) Groundwater that is contaminated shall not be required to be remediated to a level or concentration for any particular contaminant lower than the level or concentration that is migrating onto the property from another property owned and operated by another person; (7) The technical performance, effectiveness and reliability of the proposed remedial action in attaining and maintaining compliance with applicable remediation standards and required health risk standards shall be considered. In reviewing a proposed remedial action, the department or the licensed site remediation professional shall also consider the ability of the owner or operator to implement the proposed remedial action within a reasonable time frame without jeopardizing public health, safety or the environment; (8) The use of a remedial action for soil contamination that is determined by the department to be effective in its guidance document created pursuant to section 38 of P.L.1993, c.139 (C.58:10B-14), is presumed to be an appropriate remedial action if it is to be implemented on a site in the manner described by the department in the guidance document and applicable regulations and if all of the conditions for remedy selection provided for in this section are met. The burden to prove compliance with the criteria in the guidance document is with the person responsible for conducting the remediation; (9)(Deleted by amendment, P.L.1997, c.278); (10) The department shall, by rule or regulation, establish presumptive remedies, use of which shall be required on any site or area of concern to be used for residential purposes, as a child care center licensed pursuant to P.L.1983, c.492 (C.30:5B-1 et seq.), as a public school or private school as defined in N.J.S.18A:1-1, or as a charter school established pursuant to P.L.1995, c.426 (C.18A:36A-1 et seq.). The department may also issue guidelines that provide for presumptive remedies that may be required as provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection, on a site to be used for residential purposes, as a child care center, or as a public school, private school or charter school. The presumptive remedies shall be based on the historic use of the property, the nature and extent of the contamination at the site, the future use of the site and any other factors deemed relevant by the department. The department may include the use of engineering and institutional controls in the presumptive remedies authorized pursuant to this subsection. If the person responsible for conducting the remediation demonstrates to the department that the use of an unrestricted use remedial action or a presumptive remedy is impractical due to conditions at the site, or that an alternative remedy would be equally protective over time as a presumptive remedy, then an alternative remedy for the site that is protective of the public health and safety may be proposed for review and approval by the department; (11) The department may authorize a person conducting a remediation to divide a contaminated site into one or more areas of concern. For each area of concern, a different remedial action may be selected provided the requirements of this subsection are met and the remedial action selected is consistent with the future use of the property; and (12) The construction of single family residences, public schools, private schools, or charter schools, or child care centers shall be prohibited on a landfill that undergoes a remediation if engineering controls are required for the management of landfill gas or leachate. The burden to demonstrate that a remedial action is protective of public health, safety and the environment, as applicable, and has been selected in conformance with the provisions of this subsection is with the person responsible for conducting the remediation. The department may require the person responsible for conducting the remediation to supply the information required pursuant to this subsection as is necessary for the department to make a determination. h. (1) The department shall adopt regulations which establish a procedure for a person to demonstrate that a particular parcel of land contains large quantities of historical fill material. Upon a determination by the department that large quantities of historic fill material exist on that parcel of land, there is a rebuttable presumption that the department shall not require any person to remove or treat the fill material in order to comply with applicable health risk or environmental standards. In these areas the department shall establish by regulation the requirement for engineering or institutional controls that are designed to prevent exposure of these contaminants to humans, that allow for the continued use of the property, that are less costly than removal or treatment, which maintain the health risk standards as established in subsection d. of this section, and, as applicable, are protective of the environment. The department may rebut the presumption only upon a finding by the preponderance of the evidence that the use of engineering or institutional controls would not be effective in protecting public health, safety, and the environment. The department may not adopt any rule or regulation that has the effect of shifting the burden of rebutting the presumption. For the purposes of this paragraph "historic fill material" means generally large volumes of non-indigenous material, no matter what date they were emplaced on the site, used to raise the topographic elevation of a site, which were contaminated prior to emplacement and are in no way connected with the operations at the location of emplacement and which include, but are not limited to, construction debris, dredge spoils, incinerator residue, demolition debris, fly ash, and non-hazardous solid waste. Historic fill material shall not include any material which is substantially chromate chemical production waste or any other chemical production waste or waste from processing of metal or mineral ores, residues, slags or tailings. (2) The department shall develop recommendations for remedial actions in large areas of historic industrial contamination. These recommendations shall be designed to meet the health risk standards established in subsection d. of this section, and to be protective of the environment and shall take into account the industrial history of these sites, the extent of the contamination that may exist, the costs of remedial actions, the economic impacts of these policies, and the anticipated uses of these properties. The department shall issue a report to the Senate Environment Committee and to the Assembly Environment and Solid Waste Committee, or their successors, explaining these recommendations and making any recommendations for legislative or regulatory action. (3) The department may not, as a condition of allowing the use of a nonresidential use soil remediation standard, or the use of institutional or engineering controls, require the owner of that real property, except as provided in section 36 of P.L.1993, c.139 (C.58:10B-13), to restrict the use of that property through the filing of a deed easement, covenant, or condition. i. The department may not require a remedial action workplan to be prepared or implemented or engineering or institutional controls to be imposed upon any real property unless sampling performed at that real property demonstrates the existence of contamination above the applicable remediation standards. j. Upon the approval by the department or by a licensed site remediation professional of a remedial action workplan, or similar plan that describes the extent of contamination at a site and the remedial action to be implemented to address that contamination, the department may not subsequently require a change to that workplan or similar plan in order to compel a different remediation standard due to the fact that the established remediation standards have changed; however, the department may compel a different remediation standard if the difference between the new remediation standard and the remediation standard approved in the workplan or other plan differs by an order of magnitude. The limitation to the department's authority to change a workplan or similar plan pursuant to this subsection shall only apply if the workplan or similar plan is being implemented in a reasonable timeframe, as may be indicated in the approved remedial action workplan or similar plan. k. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, all remediation standards and remedial actions that involve real property located in the Pinelands area shall be consistent with the provisions of the "Pinelands Protection Act," P.L.1979, c.111 (C.13:18A-1 et seq.), any rules and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, and with section 502 of the "National Parks and Recreation Act of 1978," 16 U.S.C. s.471i; and all remediation standards and remedial actions that involve real property located in the Highlands preservation area shall be consistent with the provisions of the "Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act," P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-1 et al.), and any rules and regulations and the Highlands regional master plan adopted pursuant thereto. l. Upon the adoption of a remediation standard for a particular contaminant in soil, groundwater, or surface water pursuant to this section, the department may amend that remediation standard only upon a finding that a new standard is necessary to maintain the health risk standards established in subsection d. of section 35 of P.L.1993, c.139 (C.58:10B-12) or to protect the environment, as applicable. The department may not amend a public health based soil remediation standard to a level that would result in a health risk standard more protective than that provided for in subsection d. of section 35 of P.L.1993, c.139 (C.58:10B-12). m. Nothing in P.L.1993, c.139 shall be construed to restrict or in any way diminish the public participation which is otherwise provided under the provisions of the "Spill Compensation and Control Act," P.L.1976, c.141 (C.58:10-23.11 et seq.). n. Notwithstanding any provision of subsection a. of section 36 of P.L.1993, c.139 (C.58:10B-13) to the contrary, the department may not require a person intending to implement a remedial action at an underground storage tank facility storing heating oil for on-site consumption at a one to four family residential dwelling to provide advance notice to a municipality prior to implementing that remedial action. o. A person who has remediated a site pursuant to the provisions of this section, who was liable for the cleanup and removal costs of that discharge pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (1) of subsection c. of section 8 of P.L.1976, c.141 (C.58:10-23.11g), and who remains liable for the discharge on that site due to a possibility that a remediation standard may change, undiscovered contamination may be found, or because an engineering control was used to remediate the discharge, shall maintain with the department a current address at which that person may be contacted in the event additional remediation needs to be performed at the site. The requirement to maintain the current address shall be made part of the conditions of the permit issued pursuant to section 19 of P.L.2009, c.60 (C.58:10C-19) and the final remediation document. L.1993, c.139, s.35; amended 1997, c.278, s.17; 2004, c.120, s.81; 2009, c.60, s.47; 2010, c.87, s.3. NJSA 58:10B-13 Use of nonresidential standards or other controls, requirements 36. a. When real property is remediated to a nonresidential soil remediation standard or engineering or institutional controls are used in lieu of remediating a site to meet an established remediation standard for soil, groundwater, or surface water, the person responsible for conducting the remediation shall, as a condition of the use of that standard or control measure: (1) implement any engineering or institutional controls the department requires to prevent exposure to the contaminants, provide maintenance, as necessary, of those controls, and provide for the restriction of the use of the property by the owner in a manner that prevents exposure; (2) with the consent of the owner of the real property, provide for the recording with the office of the county recording officer, in the county in which the property is located, a notice to inform prospective holders of an interest in the property that contamination exists on the property at a level that may statutorily restrict certain uses of or access to all or part of that property, a delineation of those restrictions, a description of all specific engineering or institutional controls at the property that exist and that shall be maintained in order to prevent exposure to contaminants remaining on the property, and the written consent to the notice by the owner of the property. The notice shall be recorded in the same manner as are deeds and other interests in real property. The department shall develop a uniform deed notice that ensures the proper filing of the deed notice. The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to restrictions on the use of surface water or groundwater; (3) provide written notice to the governing body of each municipality in which the property is located that contaminants will exist at the property above residential use soil remediation standards or any other remediation standards and specifying the restrictions on the use of or access to all or part of that property and of the specific engineering or institutional controls at the property that exist and that shall be maintained; (4) post signs, as required by the department, at any location at the site where access is restricted or in those areas that must be maintained in a prescribed manner, to inform persons on the property that there are restrictions on the use of that property or restrictions on access to any part of the site; (5) maintain a list of the restrictions on site for inspection by governmental enforcement officials; and (6) prior to commencing a remedial action, notify, in writing, the governing body of each municipality wherein the property being remediated is located. The notice shall include, but not be limited to, the commencement date for the remedial action; the name, mailing address and business telephone number of the person implementing the remedial action, or his designated representative; and a brief description of the remedial action. b. If the owner of the real property does not consent to the recording of a notice pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection a. of this section, the person responsible for conducting the remediation shall implement a remedial action that meets the residential soil remediation standard in the remediation of that real property. c. Whenever engineering or institutional controls on property as provided in subsection a. of this section are no longer required, or whenever the engineering or institutional controls are changed because of the performance of subsequent remedial activities, a change in conditions at the site, or the adoption of revised remediation standards, the department shall require that the owner or operator of that property record with the office of the county recording officer a notice that the use of the property is no longer restricted or delineating the new restrictions. The person responsible for conducting the remediation shall notify, in writing, the municipality in which the property is located of the removal or change of the restrictive use conditions. d. The owner or lessee of any real property, or any person operating a business on real property, which has been remediated to a nonresidential use soil remediation standard or on which a remedial action that includes engineering or institutional controls for soil, groundwater, or surface water has been implemented to protect the public health, safety, or the environment, as applicable, shall maintain the engineering or institutional controls as required by the department. An owner, lessee, or operator who takes any action that results in the improper alteration or removal of engineering or institutional controls or who fails to maintain the engineering or institutional controls as required by the department, shall be subject to the penalties and actions set forth in section 22 of P.L.1976, c.141 (C.58:10-23.11u) and, where applicable, shall be liable for any additional remediation and damages pursuant to the provisions of section 8 of P.L.1976, c.141 (C.58:10-23.11g). The provisions of this subsection shall not apply if a notification received pursuant to subsection c. of this section authorizes all restrictions or controls to be removed from the subject property. e. Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, or any rule, regulation, or order adopted pursuant thereto to the contrary, whenever contamination at a property is remediated in compliance with all applicable soil, groundwater or surface water remediation standards that were in effect or approved by the department at the completion of the remediation, no person, except as otherwise provided in this section, shall be liable for the cost of any additional remediation that may be required by a subsequent adoption by the department of a more stringent remediation standard for a particular contaminant. Upon the adoption of a regulation that amends a remediation standard, or where the adoption of a regulation would change a remediation standard which was otherwise approved by the department, only a person who is liable to clean up and remove that contamination pursuant to section 8 of P.L.1976, c.141 (C.58:10-23.11g), and who does not have a defense to liability pursuant to subsection d. of that section, shall be liable for any additional remediation costs necessary to bring the site into compliance with the new remediation standards except that no person shall be so liable unless the difference between the new remediation standard and the level or concentration of a contaminant at the property differs by an order of magnitude. The department may compel a person who is liable for the additional remediation costs to perform additional remediation activities to meet the new remediation standard except that a person may not be compelled to perform any additional remediation activities on the site if that person can demonstrate that the existing engineering or institutional controls on the site prevent exposure to the contamination and that the site remains protective of public health, safety and the environment pursuant to section 35 of P.L.1993, c.139 (C.58:10B-12). The burden to prove that a site remains protective is on the person liable for the additional remediation costs. A person liable for the additional remediation costs who is relying on engineering or institutional controls to make a site protective, shall comply with the provisions of subsections a., b., c. and d. of this section. Nothing in the provisions of this subsection shall be construed to affect the authority of the department, pursuant to subsection f. of this section, to require additional remediation on real property where engineering controls were implemented. Nothing in the provisions of this subsection shall limit the rights of a person, other than the State, or any department or agency thereof, to bring a civil action for damages, contribution, or indemnification as provided by statutory or common law. f. Whenever the department approves or has approved, or a licensed site remediation professional implements a remedial action that includes, the use of engineering controls for the remediation of soil, groundwater, or surface water, to protect public health, safety or the environment, the department may require additional remediation of that site only if the engineering controls no longer are protective of public health, safety, or the environment. g. Whenever the department approves or has approved, or a licensed site remediation professional implements a remedial action that includes, the use of engineering or institutional controls for the remediation of soil, groundwater, or surface water, to protect public health, safety or the environment, the department shall inspect that site at least once every five years in order to ensure that the engineering and institutional controls are being properly maintained and that the controls remain protective of public health and safety and of the environment. h. A property owner of a site on which a deed notice has been recorded shall notify any person who intends to excavate on the site of the nature and location of any contamination existing on the site and of any conditions or measures necessary to prevent exposure to contaminants. L.1993, c.139, s.36; amended 1997, c.278, s.18; 2009, c.60, s.48. NJSA 58:10B-13.1 No further action letter; covenant not to sue 6. a. Whenever on or after October 16, 2009 the Department of Environmental Protection issues a no further action letter pursuant to a remediation, the person responsible for conducting the remediation shall be deemed by operation of law to have received a covenant not to sue with respect to the real property upon which the remediation has been conducted. The covenant not to sue shall be consistent with any conditions and limitations contained in the no further action letter. The covenant not to sue shall be for any area of concern remediated and may apply to the entire real property if the remediation included a preliminary assessment and, if necessary, a site investigation of the entire real property, and any other necessary remedial actions. The covenant remains effective only for as long as the real property for which the covenant was issued continues to meet the conditions of the no further action letter. Upon a finding by the department that real property or a portion thereof to which a covenant not to sue pertains, no longer meets with the conditions of the no further action letter, the department shall provide notice of that fact to the person responsible for maintaining compliance with the no further action letter. The department may allow the person a reasonable time to come into compliance with the terms of the original no further action letter. If the property does not meet the conditions of the no further action letter and if the department does not allow for a period of time to come into compliance or if the person fails to come into compliance within the time period, the covenant not to sue shall be deemed to be revoked by operation of law. Except as provided in subsection e. of this section, a covenant not to sue shall by operation of law provide for the following, as applicable: (1) a provision releasing the person who undertook the remediation from all civil liability to the State to perform any additional remediation, to pay compensation for damage to, or loss of, natural resources, for the restoration of natural resources in connection with the discharge on the property or for any cleanup and removal costs; (2) for a remediation that involves the use of engineering or institutional controls: (a) a provision requiring the person, or any subsequent owner, lessee, or operator during the person's period of ownership, tenancy, or operation, to maintain those controls, conduct periodic monitoring for compliance, and submit to the department, on a biennial basis, a certification that the engineering and institutional controls are being properly maintained and continue to be protective of public health and safety and of the environment. The certification shall state the underlying facts and shall include the results of any tests or procedures performed that support the certification; and (b) a provision that the covenant is revoked by operation of law if the engineering or institutional controls are not being maintained or are no longer in place; and (3) for a remediation that involves the use of engineering controls but not for any remediation that involves the use of institutional controls only, a provision barring the person or persons whom the covenant not to sue benefits, from making a claim against the New Jersey Spill Compensation Fund and the Sanitary Landfill Facility Contingency Fund for any costs or damages relating to the real property and remediation covered by the covenant not to sue. The covenant not to sue shall not bar a claim by any person against the New Jersey Spill Compensation Fund and the Sanitary Landfill Contingency Fund for any remediation that involves only the use of institutional controls if, after a valid no further action letter has been issued, the department orders additional remediation, except that the covenant shall bar such a claim if the department ordered additional remediation in order to remove the institutional control. b. Unless a covenant not to sue issued under this section is revoked by the department, or by operation of law, the covenant shall remain effective. The covenant not to sue shall apply to all successors in ownership of the property and to all persons who lease the property or who engage in operations on the property. c. If a covenant not to sue is revoked, liability for any additional remediation shall not be applied retroactively to any person for whom the covenant remained in effect during that person's ownership, tenancy, or operation of the property. d. A covenant not to sue and the protections it affords shall not apply to any discharge that occurs subsequent to the issuance of the no further action letter which was the basis of the issuance of the covenant, nor shall a covenant not to sue and the protections it affords relieve any person of the obligations to comply in the future with laws and regulations. e. The covenant not to sue shall be deemed to apply to any person who obtains a no further action letter as provided in subsection a. of this section. The covenant not to sue shall not provide relief from any liability, either under statutory or common law, to any person who is liable for cleanup and removal costs pursuant to subsection c. of section 8 of P.L.1976, c.141 (C.58:10-23.11g), and who does not have a defense to liability pursuant to subsection d. of that section. f.(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection, the department shall not issue covenants not to sue after the issuance of licenses to site remediation professionals pursuant to the provisions of section 12 of P.L.2009, c.60 (C.58:10C-12). (2) The department may issue a covenant not to sue that is consistent with the provisions of this section when it issues a no further action letter for a remediation of a discharge from an unregulated heating oil tank. (3) The department may issue a covenant not to sue as part of a settlement of litigation. L.1997, c.278, s.6; amended 2001, c.154, s.4; 2005, c.4, s.3; 2009, c.60, s.49; 2009, c.300. NJSA 58:10B-13.2 Covenant not to sue, provisions 31. a. After a licensed site remediation professional issues a response action outcome to the person responsible for conducting the remediation, the person shall be deemed, by operation of law, to have received a covenant not to sue with respect to the real property upon which the remediation has been conducted. The covenant not to sue shall be subject to any conditions and limitations contained in the response action outcome. The covenant not to sue shall be for any area of concern remediated and may apply to the entire real property if the remediation included a preliminary assessment and, if necessary, a site investigation of the entire real property, and any other necessary remedial actions. The covenant remains effective only for as long as the real property for which the covenant was deemed to have been issued continues to meet the conditions of the response action outcome. Upon a finding by the department that real property or a portion thereof to which a covenant not to sue pertains, no longer meets with the conditions of the response action outcome, the department shall provide notice of that fact to the person responsible for maintaining compliance with the response action outcome. The department may allow the person a reasonable time to come into compliance with the terms of the original response action outcome. If the property does not meet the conditions of the response action outcome and if the department does not allow for a period of time to come into compliance or if the person fails to come into compliance within the time period, the covenant not to sue shall be deemed to be revoked by operation of law. Except as provided in subsection e. of this section, a covenant not to sue shall by operation of law provide for the following, as applicable: (1) a provision releasing the person who undertook the remediation from all civil liability to the State to perform any additional remediation, to pay compensation for damage to, or loss of, natural resources, for the restoration of natural resources in connection with the discharge on the property or for any cleanup and removal costs; (2) for a remediation that involves the use of engineering or institutional controls: (a) a provision requiring the person, or any subsequent owner, lessee, or operator during the person's period of ownership, tenancy, or operation, to maintain those controls, conduct periodic monitoring for compliance, and submit to the department, on a biennial basis, a certification that the engineering and institutional controls are being properly maintained and continue to be protective of public health and safety and of the environment. The certification shall state the underlying facts and shall include the results of any tests or procedures performed that support the certification; and (b) a provision that the covenant is revoked by operation of law if the engineering or institutional controls are not being maintained or are no longer in place; and (3) for a remediation that involves the use of engineering controls but not for any remediation that involves the use of institutional controls only, a provision barring the person or persons whom the covenant not to sue benefits, from making a claim against the New Jersey Spill Compensation Fund and the Sanitary Landfill Facility Contingency Fund for any costs or damages relating to the real property and remediation covered by the covenant not to sue. The covenant not to sue shall not bar a claim by any person against the New Jersey Spill Compensation Fund and the Sanitary Landfill Contingency Fund for any remediation that involves only the use of institutional controls if, after a valid response action outcome has been issued, the department orders additional remediation, except that the covenant shall bar such a claim if the department ordered additional remediation in order to remove the institutional control. b. The covenant not to sue shall apply to all successors in ownership of the property and to all persons who lease the property or who engage in operations on the property. c. If a covenant not to sue is revoked, liability for any additional remediation shall not be applied retroactively to any person for whom the covenant remained in effect during that person's ownership, tenancy, or operation of the property. d. A covenant not to sue and the protections it affords shall not apply to any discharge that occurs subsequent to the issuance of the response action outcome which was the basis of the issuance of the covenant, nor shall a covenant not to sue and the protections it affords relieve any person of the obligations to comply in the future with laws, rules and regulations. e. The covenant not to sue shall be deemed to apply to any person who obtains a response action outcome as provided in subsection a. of this section. The covenant not to sue shall not provide relief from any liability, either under statutory or common law, to any person who is liable for cleanup and removal costs pursuant to subsection c. of section 8 of P.L.1976, c.141 (C.58:10-23.11g), and who does not have a defense to liability pursuant to subsection d. of that section. L.2009, c.60, s.31. NJSA 58:10B-14. Development of guidance document 38. Within 12 months of the effective date of this act, the department shall develop a guidance document for the remediation of contaminated soils. The guidance document shall include a description of remedial actions the department determines are effective in remediating soil contamination to the residential or nonresidential use soil remediation standards and that should be considered by a person performing a soil remediation. The department shall revise the guidance document periodically as it determines necessary. Adoption of the guidance document, or the revisions thereto, shall be published in the New Jersey Register but the adoption of the guidance document, or the revisions thereto, shall not otherwise be subject to the notice, comment, publication, or other requirements of the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.).

Any person who notifies the department of the discharge pursuant to this section shall be liable for all cleanup and removal costs as provided in section 8 of P.L.1976, c.141 (C.58:10-23.11g). b. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of this subsection, any person who enters into a memorandum of agreement or administrative consent order pursuant to this section and fails to remediate the discharge in accordance with the memorandum of agreement or administrative consent order, shall be subject to all penalties for violations that occurred before the effective date of P.L.1993, c.139 (C.13:1K-9.6 et al.) as well as any penalties for subsequent violations. c. The provisions of this section shall not apply to violations of a permit issued pursuant to P.L.1977, c.74 (C.58:10A-1 et seq.). d. Any documents or information provided to the department pursuant to this section may not be used in a criminal investigation or criminal prosecution against the person providing the information or documents for those violations that occurred before the effective date of this act as long as the person remediates the discharge in conformance with the administrative consent order or memorandum of agreement entered into pursuant to subsection a. of this section. L.1993,c.139,s.39. NJSA 58:10B-16 Access to property to conduct remediation 40. a. (1) Any person who undertakes the remediation of suspected or actual contamination and who requires access to conduct such remediation on real or personal property that is not owned by that person, may enter upon the property to conduct the necessary remediation if there is an agreement, in writing, between the person conducting the remediation and the owner of the property authorizing the entry onto the property. If, after good faith efforts, the person undertaking the remediation and the property owner fail to reach an agreement concerning access to the property, the person undertaking the remediation shall seek an order from the Superior Court directing the property owner to grant reasonable access to the property and the court may proceed in the action in a summary manner. (2) Such relief may include, singly or in combination: (a) A temporary or permanent injunction; (b) Assessment of the person undertaking the remediation for costs associated with any disruption in operations on the property; (c) Assessment of the person undertaking the remediation for any costs to return the property to its condition before the commencement of the remediation; (d) A requirement that the person undertaking the remediation indemnify the owner of the property for any damages, penalties or liabilities resulting from the remediation; (e) A requirement that the person undertaking the remediation indemnify the owner of the property for any liability resulting from the entry of persons onto the property to perform the remediation. b. The court shall promptly issue any access order sought pursuant to this section upon a showing that (1) a reasonable possibility exists that contamination from another site has migrated onto the owner's property, or (2) access to the property is reasonable and necessary to remediate contamination. The presence of an applicable department oversight document or a remediation obligation pursuant to law involving the property for which access is sought shall constitute prima facie evidence sufficient to support the issuance of an order. Unless the court otherwise orders for notice and for good cause shown, an action for an access order shall not be joined with non-germane issues against the owner of the property for which access is sought or other person who may be liable for the contamination. Non-germane issues shall include, but not be limited to, issues concerning contribution, treble damages, or other damages involving either the contamination or the remediation. The court may impose reasonable conditions as part of the access order, including without limitation, that the person undertaking the remediation take all reasonable measures to minimize the disruption to the property and the activities conducted there and return the property to its condition prior to the commencement of remediation. c. The department may not impose or seek to impose any civil or civil administrative penalties upon any person for failure to perform a remediation on property not owned by that person within the time schedule required by regulation on property not owned by that person if (1) the failure to perform the remediation was the result of an inability of that person to enter upon real or personal property owned by another person, and (2) the person took all appropriate action pursuant to this section to obtain access to the property. d. Nothing herein shall be construed as limiting the rights of the owner of the property against which the access order is issued to initiate a civil action to seek any damages available under law. e. Nothing herein shall be construed as limiting the rights of the person conducting the remediation from initiating any subsequent civil action against the owner of the property upon which access was ordered.

The disputed decision shall be reviewed, and a determination shall be made, by the next level of the department's management, and the review may continue, upon the request of the person seeking review, until the commissioner or his designee has issued a decision on the dispute. Each successive level of management review and the resulting determination on the dispute, shall occur within seven days of the department's receipt of the request for review. b. Within 60 days of the effective date of P.L.1993, c.139, the department shall develop guidelines that establish a procedure through which a person conducting a remediation of a contaminated site may dispute a department decision concerning the remediation. Those guidelines shall include provisions for an expedited review procedure under which the commissioner, or his designee, shall issue a decision on the dispute within 21 calendar days of the date on which the request for that review was received.

The decision whether or not to enter into a redevelopment agreement is solely within the discretion of the Chief Executive Officer and Secretary of the Commerce and Economic Growth Commission and the State Treasurer and both must agree to enter into the redevelopment agreement. Nothing in P.L.1997, c.278 (C.58:10B-1.1 et al.) may be construed to compel the Secretary and the State Treasurer to enter into any redevelopment agreement. The Chief Executive Officer and Secretary of the Commerce and Economic Growth Commission, in consultation with the State Treasurer shall negotiate the terms and conditions of any redevelopment agreement on behalf of the State.

NJAC 5:85-7.1 Introduction (a) The State Planning Act includes the legislative finding that significant economies, efficiencies and savings in the development process would be realized by private sector enterprise and by public sector development agencies if the several levels of government would cooperate in preparing and adhering to sound and integrated plans. The Legislature further observed that a State Development and Redevelopment Plan needed to be designed for use as a tool for assessing suitable locations for infrastructure, housing, economic growth and conservation. The Legislature emphasized the importance of providing local governments in this State with the technical resources and guidance necessary to assist them in developing land use plans and procedures, which are based on sound planning information and practice, and to facilitate the development of local plans, which are consistent with State and regional plans and programs. To achieve the desired sound planning, the State Planning Act mandates that the Office of State Planning (predecessor to the Office of Smart Growth) provide advice and assistance to regional, county and local planning units. (b) The State Planning Act specifically authorizes and requires the Office of State Planning to provide planning service to other agencies or instrumentalities of State government, to review the plans prepared by them, and to coordinate planning so as to avoid or mitigate conflicts between plans. (c) The State Planning Act also requires the Office of State Planning to develop and promote procedures to facilitate cooperation and coordination among State agencies, regional entities, and local governments with regard to the development of plans, programs and policies, which affect land use, environmental, capital and economic development issues. (d) The goals, policies, targets and indicators of the State Plan have been designed to address the concerns of the need to maintain beneficial growth, improve environmental quality, insure cost-effective delivery of infrastructure and other public services, improve governmental coordination, preserve the quality of community life and redevelop the State's major urban areas. Implementation of the State Plan is expected to achieve a balance among these concerns and to maximize the well-being for the State and its residents. (e) This Plan Endorsement subchapter delineates the process developed by the Office of Smart Growth (successor to Office of State Planning) to increase the degree of consistency among municipal, county, regional and State agency plans and the State Plan and to facilitate implementation of these plans. NJAC 5:85-7.2 Purpose and scope (a) The purpose of this subchapter is to delineate procedural and substantive requirements of plan endorsement, including minimum submission requirements petitioner must meet in order to achieve plan endorsement and qualify for associated benefits; responsibilities of relevant State agencies in participating in plan endorsement; and responsibilities of the Office of Smart Growth in administering the plan endorsement process. The Office of Smart Growth shall prepare Guidelines for petitioners seeking to pursue plan endorsement. The Guidelines shall be posted on the Office of Smart Growth website at: http://www.njsmartgrowth.com and shall be periodically updated. (b) This subchapter applies to municipalities, counties, regional planning entities and other relevant planning entities seeking plan endorsement. (c) The State Planning Commission may approve a petition for plan endorsement submitted by a petitioner based upon recommendations of the Office of Smart Growth, in consultation with relevant regional, State and Federal agencies and after consideration of public comment. (d) State agencies shall provide State agency benefits upon an approval of plan endorsement as described in the document entitled "Plan Endorsement Benefits" and posted on the Office of Smart Growth website at: http://www.njsmartgrowth.com. Additional State agency benefits, as appropriate and feasible, shall be added to said document as they become available. (e) State agencies shall make available certain State agency benefits, and planning assistance, agreed upon by the petitioner and relevant State agencies during the plan endorsement process, once the Office of Smart Growth has issued a Certificate of Eligibility. HISTORY : Amended by R.2009 d.286, effective September 21, 2009. See: 41 N.J.R. 1551(a), 41 N.J.R. 3407(b).

Municipalities within counties that have been granted plan endorsement shall only qualify for State agency benefits associated with plan endorsement upon receiving plan endorsement of said municipality; 3. Regional plans for any regional planning entity regarding a regional planning theme not associated with an intention to amend the State Plan Policy Map; 4. Regional plans for two or more municipalities sharing a common regional planning theme relating to an intention to amend the State Plan Policy Map, provided that each affected municipality individually petition for plan endorsement. Municipalities within regions that submit regional plans shall only qualify for State agency benefits associated with plan endorsement upon receiving plan endorsement of said municipality. Regional and municipal plan endorsement may be pursued concurrently; 5. Special resource area plans as defined in the State Development and Redevelopment Plan submitted by the relevant regional planning entity; 6. Neighborhood plans in municipalities designated as Urban Centers by the State Planning Commission, submitted by the municipal governing body, provided that endorsement of any neighborhood plan is part of an identified overall strategy for eventual endorsement of the master plan and supporting plan elements for the entire municipality; and 7. Plans that previously received Initial Plan Endorsement from the Commission. (b) Plans submitted in connection with a petition for initial plan endorsement that have been deemed complete by the Office of Smart Growth prior to April 20, 2009, shall, upon petitioner's request, be considered for initial plan endorsement under the prior State Planning Rules governing plan endorsement. HISTORY: Amended by R.2009 d.286, effective September 21, 2009. See: 41 N.J.R. 1551(a), 41 N.J.R. 3407(b).

These benefits shall be made available only in an area that is the subject of a petition for plan endorsement, provided that the plan has been endorsed by the State Planning Commission. Each list of benefits, funding grants or other programs shall specify: 1. The benefits that will take effect once a petition for plan endorsement has been approved by the State Planning Commission pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:85-7.19; 2. The information that must be included in the petition, the actions that must be taken by petitioner as delineated in an action plan or planning and implementation agreement in order for each such benefit to be made available; and 3. Those benefits that only apply in limited areas and the extent and reasons for those limitations. (c) Each State agency member of the State Planning Commission, where appropriate and feasible, shall commit to making any modifications to State agency rules and programs that may be necessary to allow those benefits to accrue to the petitioner. (d) Each State agency member of the Commission, and any other relevant State agency or authority, at the request of the Commission or the Executive Director, shall share the following responsibilities:> 1. Review and assess the plan submitted by a petitioner and provide a written analysis of those planning documents within the time periods provided in this subchapter;> 2. Provide guidance and assistance with respect to programs available through each State agency or authority that may assist a petitioner to achieve plan endorsement and implementation of a petitioner's planning strategy in a manner that is consistent with and promotes the goals and policies of the State Plan; 3. Prepare a list of plan implementation mechanisms that may be required for a petitioner to implement an endorsed plan to effectuate land use patterns that are consistent with the State Plan and provide adequate and appropriate examples of each such mechanism. In the event that an appropriate example of a required plan implementation mechanism does not exist, the relevant State agency will work with the Office of Smart Growth and the petitioner to develop same, which can later be used as an example; 4. Make reasonable recommendations to the petitioner and the Commission concerning requirements for a petitioner to receive plan endorsement and how to adequately implement the plan, once endorsed, by developing reasonable and appropriate planning implementation strategies for inclusion in a planning and implementation agreement to achieve consistency with the goals, policies and strategies of the State Plan; and 5. Facilitate prioritized technical assistance and coordinated regulatory review of applications of entities with endorsed plans, where the application is determined to be consistent with the endorsed plan and the goals, policies and strategies of the State Development and Redevelopment Plan and takes into account relevant State agency policies, rules and regulations.

(b) A waiver may be granted pursuant to (a) above, provided the Executive Director determines that a petitioner has previously satisfactorily completed the requirement, or has substantially complied with the intent of the requirement. The determination will be based on a consideration of whether standards for plan endorsement as delineated in this subchapter and, if appropriate, whether additional relevant requirements based on guidance provided by the Office of Smart Growth in plan endorsement guidelines and related guidance documents and as agreed upon between the Office of Smart Growth and petitioner, have been met. (c) A petitioner may request a waiver for any provision of the plan endorsement process pursuant to (a) above, at any time.

NJAC 5:85-8.1 State Plan Policy Map (a) The official map of the State Development and Redevelopment Plan is entitled the "State Plan Policy Map" and is comprised of a series of maps encompassing the geographic area of the State of New Jersey. (b) Any other graphic representation, at any scale, of delineations and other pertinent data contained on the State Plan Policy Map that is included in the State Development and Redevelopment Plan or any other document, is for illustrative purposes only and is not to be considered the official map of the State Development and Redevelopment Plan as outlined in (a) above.

NJAC 5:85-8.2 Purpose In most cases, the State Plan Policy Map reflects the intergovernmental consensus arrived at during the cross-acceptance process. While the cross-acceptance process provides sufficient data, coordination and dialogue to prepare the State Plan Policy Map, new research, conditions and events may also suggest appropriate changes to the State Plan Policy Map. The purpose of this subchapter, therefore, is to create a process for amending the State Plan Policy Map after adoption of the State Development and Redevelopment Plan in order to accommodate such newly discovered or newly important conditions, situations or knowledge that emerge as the State Plan is applied by State and regional agencies, as well as municipalities and counties. In addition, it is necessary to address planning area changes and designation of centers, cores and nodes that evolve through the plan endorsement process.
