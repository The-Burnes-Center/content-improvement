Tahesha Way, Lt. Governor and Secretary of State PNew Jersey Historical Commission Board Approves $2.5 Million in Statewide Fiscal Year 2019 General Operating Support, Project, and County History Partnership Program Grant Support Funding to Support History Organizations, Projects, and Programs across all 21 Counties TRENTON, N.J. – Furthering its mission to support and expand the state’s unique historical legacy and chronicle its ongoing impact on the nation and the world, the New Jersey Historical Commission board today approved $2.5 million in Fiscal Year 2019 (FY 19) grant funding to 80 historical organizations, museums, historic sites, archives, libraries, individuals, and county re-grant agencies across the state. The $2.5 million in FY 19 funding will support the New Jersey Historical Commission’s General Operating Support (GOS) program, which covers an array of operational expenses for qualified history organizations; Projects and Co-Sponsored Projects, which includes New Jersey-based historical research, exhibits, programs, and archival work; and the County History Partnership Program (CHPP), which provides all 21 counties with funding to support local history groups statewide. “From essential organizational support to fostering the growth of educational programs in history and civics, the benefits of investing in our historic assets are extraordinary in economic terms and will contribute greatly to enhancing the state’s quality of life,” noted Secretary of State Tahesha Way. “This funding represents our commitment to strengthening New Jersey’s historical community in a variety of critical ways." In Fiscal Year 2017, history organizations that received approximately $1.45 million in General Operating Support funding leveraged $20.5 million in total spending, offered on-and-off-site programs to almost 2 million people, enjoyed over 7.3 million website visitors, and supported nearly 700 full and part-time jobs statewide. The FY 19 awards are the third to be given after a comprehensive grant reevaluation process, which sought input from grantees, current and prospective applicants, and experts from various history-based disciplines on how to strengthen already effective programs even further. The changes were officially implemented in Fiscal Year 2017. “This year will complete the initial, three-year grant cycle under the new guidelines and we’re pleased with the considerable progress in the overall commitment to expanding diversity in both programming and audiences by our grantees statewide,” said Sara Cureton, executive director of the New Jersey Historical Commission. “The coming months will see us take a proactive approach to outreach and dialogue in order to build on this foundation of success in the years ahead, leading to our ultimate goal of raising awareness of the relevance of history to every New Jerseyan, every day.” For more information on the eligibility and purpose of each grant program, including the guidelines themselves, please visit the New Jersey Historical Commission’s homepage: History.NJ.gov . The New Jersey Historical Commission’s grant programs are determined through an independent, third-party peer review process. All funding is made possible by a portion of the revenue produced by the state’s Hotel/Motel Tax legislation.
