Tahesha Way, Lt. Governor and Secretary of State Christie Administration Announces All Twelve Atlantic City Casinos Back in Operation TRENTON, NJ – With the re-opening of the Atlantic Club Casino Hotel this morning, Governor Chris Christie and Division of Gaming Enforcement Director David Rebuck announced that all hotel operations and gaming activity at the twelve Atlantic City casinos are back in operation. “This has been an extremely difficult time for Atlantic City and the State of New Jersey. With the re-opening of the casinos, the employees and the residents can now move forward to welcome visitors back to Atlantic City,” said Governor Christie. On Friday, November 2, Governor Christie lifted the mandatory evacuation order signed October 27, 2012 for Atlantic City. Director Rebuck then signed an order allowing the casinos to reopen at 10 a.m. Division investigators and State Police personnel were on site at each property to ensure that the gaming floors opened as soon as they were able to do so. “I commend the casinos for working cooperatively with the Division of Gaming Enforcement during this time of extreme emergency,” said Director Rebuck. “As recovery efforts continue in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, this reopening is another important step and symbol in our state's recovery and return to normalcy for New Jersey residents.” Back to top Original text Rate this translation Your feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate
