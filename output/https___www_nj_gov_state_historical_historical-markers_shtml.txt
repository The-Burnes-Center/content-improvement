Tahesha Way, Lt. Governor and Secretary of State Historical Markers in New Jersey The New Jersey Historical Commission will be reinstating the State Historical Marker Program in preparation for America's 250th in 2026. Please find below information about the newly relaunched program as well as the history of the markers erected by the State in the 1930s, 1960s, and 1970s. New Jersey Historical Marker Survey In preparation for America's 250th in 2026, the New Jersey State Historical Marker Program will install new markers for the first time in 50 years, and we need your help! Let us know what themes and topics you would like to see on a historical marker by taking our short survey . The survey will take less than 5 minutes to complete and is open through January 24, 2025. Your answers will help us set priorities and guidelines for the program. History of the Program All across New Jersey, hundreds of historical markers detail and commemorate events, individuals, sites, and themes significant to the state, nation, and region’s history. The State of New Jersey produced two series of historical markers, the first in the 1930s and the second in the 1960s. Those produced in the 1930s (1931-1942) were erected by the New Jersey Commission on Historic Sites and were made out of cast aluminum and mounted on poles. The markers from the 1960s (1961-1972) were installed by the New Jersey Historic Sites Office to commemorate the 300th anniversary of New Jersey’s establishment as a colony. These were constructed out of thinner sheet metal and mounted on poles, buildings, and fenceposts, among other surfaces. View diagrams of a 1930s and 1960s marker. Diagrams courtesy of Robert Craig, NJ Historic Preservation Office, 2000 The vast majority of these historical markers commemorate significant events and persons from the Revolutionary War era in New Jersey, but other topics include notable New Jerseyans, industrial history, colonial history, historical places of worship, transportation history, and many other topics. While not all of these markers are still standing, the New Jersey Historical Commission is committed to documenting the history, location, and text of these historical markers. Below, the NJHC has created a comprehensive list of these historical markers. Organized by county, users may discover a marker’s location, whether it is recorded as missing, its date of installation, and its text. If you believe you have found a state historical marker previously documented as missing or absent from our list, please contact NJHC Programs & Communications Manager Rachel Thimke at rachel.thimke@sos.nj.gov . If you would like to stay up to date on all announcements about future historical marker programs, please sign up for our mailing list .
