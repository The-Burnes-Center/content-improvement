The legislation calls for the New Jersey Historical Commission to establish a Black Heritage Trail “to promote awareness and appreciation of Black history, heritage, and culture” that will “highlight Black heritage sites through historical markers and a trail-like path that connects the stories of Black life and resiliency.” Under this program, the Historical Commission will work in cooperation with other state agencies, such the Historic Preservation Office, the Division of Travel and Tourism, as well as local governments, owners or operators of Black heritage sites, and others to identify a series of sites. The bill also names the New Jersey Black Cultural and Heritage Initiative Foundation as a principal collaborator, due to its mission that includes broadening, deepening and diversifying statewide participation in and appreciation for Black arts, history and culture. The New Jersey Historical Commission recognizes the contributions of the inaugural African American History Program director Giles R. Wright, New Jersey historian Robert Craig and the Sankofa Collaborative on their work around Black history in New Jersey.
