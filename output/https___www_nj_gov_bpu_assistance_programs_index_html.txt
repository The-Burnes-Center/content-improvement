(Some utility companies forgive up to ¼ of the customer’s overdue balance once every three months).

The customer should call their utility company with any Fresh Start questions but can reach out to the Board of Public Utilities at 800-624-0241 or file a complaint online at: www.nj.gov/bpu/assistance/complaints if the customer cannot resolve the issue with their utility company.
