Tahesha Way, Lt. Governor and Secretary of State Vasser Named Acting Executive Director of the New Jersey Division of Travel and Tourism TRENTON, N.J. – Secretary of State Tahesha Way announced the appointment of travel and tourism industry leader, Jeff Vasser, as the Acting Executive Director of the New Jersey Division of Travel and Tourism. “I am confident Jeff’s longevity and solid background with the tourism industry will greatly benefit the growth of New Jersey Travel and Tourism,” said Secretary Way. “Tourism is one of New Jersey’s most vital industries, boosting the state’s economy as it contributes to job creation and increased tax revenue for the state. Visitor spending and visitation continues to show positive growth in the state, and Jeff Vasser will work to strengthen and grow the industry in all 21 counties.” Vasser was most recently the executive director of the Central PA Convention & Visitors Bureau and prior to that CEO of the Caribbean Hotel & Tourism Association based in Miami. For 11 years, Jeff served as president of the Atlantic City Convention & Visitors Authority, overseeing the daily operations of the public authority responsible for two major convention and event facilities and marketing the destination that anchors the region's $8 billion tourism industry. Prior to that, he served as a Senior Consultant with the Public Sector/Gaming and Entertainment Group of Deloitte & Touche having done feasibility studies for tourism, arts and culture, and sports-related clients. Vasser was also Chief Financial Officer of Cipriani International, a $60 million hotel, retail, and foodservice firm overseeing areas such as accounting and finance to human resources, facilities, and IT. Tourism in New Jersey generates $45.4 billion in total economic impact and is the seventh largest employer in the state, employing more than a half million people. With non–shore counties generating the largest share of tourism revenues, to the tune of 52%, maintaining New Jersey’s legacy as a beach destination, while promoting tourism destinations around the entire Garden State, will be a vital part of Vasser’s job. “The New Jersey Tourism Industry Association is excited to have a veteran tourism professional appointed as the Acting Executive Director of the New Jersey Division of Travel and Tourism appointed in the early days of Governor Murphy’s administration. Jeff Vasser is well known throughout the tourism industry and we look forward to working with him to continue to grow tourism and enhance New Jersey’s reputation as a premier destination,” said Vicki Clark, President of the New Jersey Tourism Industry Association.
