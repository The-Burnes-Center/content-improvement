Any person who is entitled by law to the custody of public records shall demand the same from any person in whose possession they may be, and such records forthwith shall be delivered to the officer charged by law with their custody. This law was and is retrospective, retroactive and founded in common law and colonial and early state statutes regarding the preservation of public records. Through the New Jersey State Constitution of 2 July 1776, which adopted the full extent of colonial law then in place, and subsequent constitutions and legislation, Title 47 of New Jersey Statutes is applicable and enforceable with respect to official records of both the Colony and State of New Jersey and respective subdivisions. By law, the State of New Jersey retains ownership of any and all public records regardless of the circumstances of custody, alienation or provenance. New Jersey public records cannot be legally held by another party without a depository agreement duly executed by, or with the approval of, the [New Jersey Division of Archives and Records Management]. Please be advised that New Jersey State Archives has reported the theft of the documents listed in the pages linked below to both the New Jersey State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). One or both of these agencies will be notified should any of these documents be advertised for sale or auction, or discovered to be in the custody of any person, corporation, organization or agency other than New Jersey State Archives, which is the legal owner. Be further advised that New Jersey State Archives invites the voluntary return of any such documents to the State of New Jersey. In such instances, the State Archives will suspend formal demand and legal process to recover such documents and will, upon receipt of them, acknowledge the same as a donation to the State Archives. The State may also exercise its discretion in negotiating mutually beneficial terms for the return of such documents and/or the formal acknowledgement of their legal ownership by the State. This may include planned public and/or media events, such as our celebration of the Bernstein and Sang Donations , and/or relative to institutions, a scheduled, eventual records transfer. Please contact: njarchives@sos.nj.gov or call 609-292-9507 (Joseph Klett) or 609-292-1570 (Ellen Callahan) should you have questions, would like to report the whereabouts of alienated public records of New Jersey, or would like to arrange for the donation of records. Lists of Missing Records Public records known to be alienated from the State include, but are not limited to, the following: Enrolled Laws of the Royal Colony of New Jersey: 1703 – 1711 1714 – 1716 1717 – 1725 1728 – 1740 1741 – 1749 1751 – 1756 1757 – 1761 1762 – 1764 1765 1766 – 1768 1769 – 1772 1774 – 1775 Enrolled Laws of the State of New Jersey: 1776 – 1777 1778 1779 1780 – 1782 1783 – 1786 1787 – 1804 Correspondence of Governor William Livingston: 1776 1777 1778 – 1779 1780 – 1785 Miscellaneous Filings of the Office of the Secretary of State: 1758 - 1900 Legislative Filings: (list in development) Military Papers: (list in development) County and Municipal Records: (list in development) Ethical Standards for Archivists and Table of Returned Public Records Note that the State of New Jersey has recovered alienated public records from private individuals, manuscript dealers, auction houses and institutional collections as far back as the 1860s. In most cases, this has occurred through direct donation of alienated public records to the State Archives. Various historical repositories have returned alienated public records to the State, such acquisitions typically having been accessioned by the repository prior to the recognition of ethical standards for archivists. Specifically, the Society of American Archivists (SAA) has promulgated the following: “Archivists' Code of Ethics”(1992): III. Collecting Policies ...[Archivists] do not compete for acquisitions when competition would endanger the integrity or safety of documentary materials of long-term value, or solicit the records of an institution that has an established archives... “Archivists' Code of Ethics”(2005): II. Professional Relationships ... Archivists cooperate, collaborate, and respect each institution and its mission and collecting policy. Respect and cooperation form the basis of all professional relationships with colleagues and users. IX. Law Archivists must uphold all federal, state, and local laws. In some cases formal action under NJS Title 47 (cited above) preceded the recovery of the alienated records. This was done in the form of notice by the Division of Archives and Records Management or the Attorney General’s Office, investigation by law enforcement, judicial complaint, court injunction, or a combination of these. As the table below demonstrates, since its founding the State Archives has responded to known advertisements and reports as to the location of alienated public records. In all cases where a legal claim was formally asserted, the State’s statutory ownership and prior filing of the alienated documents were thoroughly researched and proven to the satisfaction of executive, legal and/or judicial authorities. In cases where the party notified complied without adjudication of the State’s claim, the return of the document(s) was acknowledged as a charitable donation. New Jersey State Archives gratefully recognizes the return of the public records listed in the table below, dating from the establishment of the former Bureau of Archives and History (predecessor of the Division of Archives and Records Management) to the present. Again, most were direct donations by civic-minded individuals and institutions in support of the democratic and legal principles of public access to government records and the rightful ownership of them by the people, and nationally accepted ethical standards for archivists.
