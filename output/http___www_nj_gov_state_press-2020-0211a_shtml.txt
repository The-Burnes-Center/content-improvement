Tahesha Way, Lt. Governor and Secretary of State Survey of K-12 Social Studies Education is Part of Planning for the 250th Anniversary of the American Revolution TRENTON - The 2020 New Jersey Social Studies Survey is now available online for all New Jersey schools, kindergarten to twelfth grade. The survey asks for information on the teaching and learning of social studies in all New Jersey schools in preparation for the observance of the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States. It was released on January 20, 2020; the reporting deadline is February 28, 2020. The Social Studies Survey measures social studies course offerings, student participation, dedicated social studies resources, district policy, instructional support, and the extent to which community assets are utilized in New Jersey’s schools. Because the survey asks for information on programs in each school in the district, school administrators may want to involve their district social studies supervisor in gathering the data needed for the survey. New Jersey Commissioner of Education Lamont Repollet commented that “we hope the survey results will provide schools with tools to strengthen student learning regarding the founding of the United States and New Jersey’s role in the American Revolution.“ New Jersey Secretary of State Tahesha Way highlighted the importance of social studies instruction in schools, noting that “In my role as the chief elections officer for the state of New Jersey, I see firsthand how important it is for students to understand the history of our state and nation, and the vital role we all play through voting and sometimes serving as elected officials. This survey will guide us in developing strategies to strengthen social studies education, including civics, in our schools.” In the summer of 2018, Governor Phil Murphy signed legislation charging the New Jersey Historical Commission with the task of establishing a planning framework “to ensure that the State is appropriately recognized for its role in the American Revolution.” A public-private partnership between the New Jersey Historical Commission and the Crossroads of the American Revolution National Heritage is coordinating this preparation. This partnership serves a two-fold purpose: To plan and implement statewide history research, marketing, and capital enhancement projects for the benefit of all communities in the state; and To support and facilitate educational and commemorative activities of local communities, historic sites, legacy groups, and related stakeholders across New Jersey.
