Tahesha Way, Lt. Governor and Secretary of State Crossroads of the American Revolution Selected as Not-For-Profit Partner for New Jersey’s 250th Anniversary of the United States Commemoration Efforts Crossroads of the American Revolution National Heritage Area will join the New Jersey Historical Commission in planning for 250th Anniversary of the U.S. in 2026 TRENTON, N.J. - Crossroads of the American Revolution National Heritage Area has been selected as the private sector partner to work with the New Jersey Historical Commission in planning the state’s activities marking the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States in 2026. The selection was made following the passage of legislation A-4194/S-2738 (Coughlin/Weinberg, Beach) requiring the New Jersey Historical Commission to establish a program for commemorations and observance of the 250th anniversary of the United States; permits the NJHC to enter into a public-private partnership agreement in preparation for the anniversary; and appropriates $500,000 for those purposes. Designated by an Act of the U.S. Congress to administer the Crossroads of the American Revolution National Heritage Area, Crossroads has built a network of more than 130 heritage and history groups, representing more than 200 Revolutionary-era sites in New Jersey. The organization promotes the state’s Revolutionary heritage and events, and provides professional development training to help organizations present authentic portrayals of 18th century life in the state. “Crossroads of the American Revolution has promoted a greater understanding of Revolutionary-era historic sites and landscapes in New Jersey since 2006. We are delighted to partner with an organization that inspires community pride, stewardship, and civic engagement through their work supporting New Jersey’s rich Revolutionary heritage,” said New Jersey Historical Commission Executive Director, Sara Cureton. Programming for the anniversary will highlight New Jersey’s influential role in the consequential moments in the nation’s history – from the American Revolution, to the fight for women’s suffrage, the development of transformative new technologies, and the Civil Rights Movement. Through these efforts, the New Jersey Historical Commission and Crossroads of the American Revolution plan to raise awareness of the importance of historical education to an informed and engaged electorate, while growing the $2.8 billion that heritage-based tourism contributes annually to the state’s economy. The public is encouraged to visit the New Jersey Historical Commission History.NJ.gov and Crossroads of the American Revolution RevolutionaryNJ.org webpages and social media sites in the coming weeks for more information and developments. About the New Jersey Historical Commission The New Jersey Historical Commission (NJHC) is a state agency dedicated to the advancement of public knowledge and preservation of New Jersey history.
