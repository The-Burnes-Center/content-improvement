OUR MISSION: GIVEN TO US BY THE PEOPLE OF NEW JERSEY In 1966, the legislature passed and the governor signed a law creating the NJ State Council on the Arts and directing us to do all that is necessary and appropriate to: support, encourage, and foster public interest in the arts; enlarge public and private resources devoted to the arts; promote freedom of expression in the arts; and facilitate the inclusion of art in every public building in New Jersey. HOW WE ARE FUNDED Public support for the arts in New Jersey is drawn from a dedicated, renewable revenue source--the Hotel/Motel Occupancy Fee--established in 2003. Under this law, a percentage of the fees collected shall be annually allocated to the Arts Council. Additionally, the Arts Council receives an annual, competitive federal grant from the National Endowment for the Arts.

Since its creation, the Council’s volunteer members and professional staff have worked to improve the quality of life in New Jersey through strategic support for the arts. With annual appropriations from the State Legislature as well as annual federal grants from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), the Council designs and carries out a dynamic program of financial and technical support services for New Jersey artists and nonprofit organizations. The Council has priority programs in arts education, artists' services, community arts development, folk arts, cultural facilities development, community cultural planning, and arts marketing. The Council works with a broad array of partner organizations in carrying out this work. Among its programs, the Council administers the Public Buildings Arts Inclusion Act through which works of art are commissioned and installed in new state construction as well as the 1987 Cultural Centers Bond Act through which cultural centers are built and improved. The Council's programs and services have earned national recognition for excellence, innovation, and responsiveness to community needs.
