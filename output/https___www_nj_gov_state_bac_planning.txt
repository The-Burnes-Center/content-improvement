Tahesha Way, Lt. Governor and Secretary of State The Office for Planning Advocacy within the New Jersey Department of State's Business Action Center (BAC), provides administrative support to the New Jersey State Planning Commission, and coordinates statewide planning to protect the environment and guide future growth into compact, mixed-use development and redevelopment. The office implements the goals of the State Development and Redevelopment Plan and integrates that planning with administrative and State agency programs and priorities to achieve comprehensive, long-term planning at all levels of government and the private sector. The office also pursues other activities to improve intergovernmental coordination and cooperation as defined by the State Planning Act. The New Jersey State Planning Act ( N.J.S.A. 52:18A-196 ), was signed into law on January 5, 1986. In the Act, the Legislature declared that the State of New Jersey needs sound and integrated "statewide planning" to "…conserve its natural resources, revitalize its urban centers, protect the quality of its environment, and provide needed housing and adequate public services at a reasonable cost while promoting beneficial economic growth, development and renewal." To accomplish these goals, the Act established the State Planning Commission and the Office of State Planning (now the Office for Planning Advocacy), and called for a State Development and Redevelopment Plan (“State Plan”).
