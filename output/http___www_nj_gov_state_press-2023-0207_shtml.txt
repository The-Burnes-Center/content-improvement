Tahesha Way, Lt. Governor and Secretary of State New Jersey Cultural Trust Approves Over $500,000 in FY 2023 Institutional and Financial Stabilization Grants Funding to Strengthen Organizational Capacity of 16 Diverse Arts Organizations Statewide TRENTON, N.J. – Advancing its ongoing commitment to ensuring a stable and healthy cultural industry, the New Jersey Cultural Trust has announced $541,427 in FY 2023 Institutional and Financial Stabilization grant awards to 16 qualified arts organizations statewide. The Cultural Trust Board voted to approve these awards at an open public meeting held virtually on January 23, 2023. With the FY 2023 awards, the Cultural Trust has now awarded over $9.6 million in funding for financial stabilization and historic preservation projects across New Jersey to date. “The work of the New Jersey Cultural Trust is critical to maintaining New Jersey’s celebrated cultural and creative industry,” said New Jersey Secretary of State Tahesha Way. “Financially and operationally stable cultural organizations are the ones that have the capacity to contribute the most to their communities. Especially in such unpredictable times, we are proud that the Cultural Trust is able to make these essential, focused investments in the sustainability of our state’s cultural assets." Unique among the other grant programs within the Department of State, Cultural Trust grant funding is not the result of a direct budget appropriation, but rather derives from the interest earnings accrued annually by the Trust Fund, which was created by the Cultural Trust Act of 2000. The purpose of the legislation was to provide an additional, permanent funding source for arts, history, and cultural institutions, with a concentration on initiatives that build long-term resilience. Pursuant to the Cultural Trust Act, annual Cultural Trust grants are awarded following a third-party, independent peer review process by qualified persons employing uniform evaluation criteria. Awards are based on recommendations from the New Jersey State Council on the Arts, New Jersey Historical Commission, and the New Jersey Historic Trust. For FY 2023, recommendations were made by the New Jersey State Council on the Arts. Awards of up to $40,000 were available for projects that addressed the financial, operational, and capacity challenges that have a significant impact on organizations’ ability to serve their communities. Eligible projects for consideration included proposals for deficit reduction, capacity building, establishing working capital, establishing cash reserves, strategic planning, professional development, and technological advancements, among others.
