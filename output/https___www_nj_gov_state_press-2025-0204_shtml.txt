Tahesha Way, Lt. Governor and Secretary of State Changes in Signature Requirements for New Jersey Election Petitions Become Law TRENTON, NJ - The New Jersey Division of Elections advises that a change in state election law has increased the number of petition signatures required for candidates to qualify for the ballot. Governor Phil Murphy has signed A-5117/S-3994, which modifies the number of petition signatures required for candidates to be placed on primary, general, nonpartisan municipal, and school election ballots. The law went into effect on February 3, 2025 and is retroactive to January 1, 2025. Therefore, the law will impact candidates running for office in 2025. The following changes apply to candidates filing petitions with the New Jersey Division of Elections to pursue a party nomination in the 2025 New Jersey Primary Election to be held June 10, 2025: Candidates seeking their party’s nomination for Governor must submit a petition with at least 2,500 signatures from qualified registered New Jersey voters to the New Jersey Division of Elections. Candidates seeking their party’s nomination for the General Assembly must submit a petition with at least 250 signatures from qualified registered voters within the legislative district. 2025 Primary Election candidates may submit a petition using the petition forms published before January 2025, provided the forms are supported by the correct number of signatures as required by A-5117/S-3994. The new law provides that the mere use of the previously issued forms is not a basis for a legal challenge to the petition. The following changes apply to independent candidates filing petitions with the New Jersey Division of Elections to be candidates in the 2025 New Jersey General Election to be held November 4, 2025: Independent candidates for Governor must submit a petition with at least 2,000 signatures of qualified registered voters of the state. Independent candidates for the General Assembly must submit a petition with at least 250 signatures of qualified registered voters in the Legislative district.
