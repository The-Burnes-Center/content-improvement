Tahesha Way, Lt. Governor and Secretary of State New Jersey Historical Commission Announces Inaugural Inclusive History Grant Program Recipients Grants will fund projects exploring under-represented narratives in New Jersey history TRENTON, N.J. – Advancing its essential mission to explore and promote history that is representative of the state’s population and diversity of contributions, the New Jersey Historical Commission (NJHC) has awarded the inaugural round of awards for its FY 2023 Inclusive History Grant Program (IHGP). The FY 2023 IHGP awards totaling $306,123 went to 14 organizations statewide for a disparate array of work across the disciplines of archeology, research, interpretive planning, and oral history. All funded projects will explore under-represented narratives in New Jersey history with a goal of expanding inclusive, community-centered interpretation and resources offered by historic sites and history organizations for a public audience. “Telling complex, diverse, and nuanced histories will continue to be a priority of the New Jersey History Commission, and this funding is an important next step to achieving that essential goal,” noted Secretary of State Tahesha Way. “These grants will support a wide range of disciplines and give our history stakeholders the tools to create and maximize the educational and programmatic impacts for diverse audiences ahead of, during, and in the aftermath of America’s upcoming 250th anniversary.” The IHGP was developed in alignment with the Strategic and Interpretive frameworks of RevolutionNJ – New Jersey’s commemorative initiative for the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States. In doing so, grants will actively address the shared goals to: Tell a diverse and inclusive story about America’s past that invites participation from all New Jerseyans. Encourage the growth of organizational capacity at New Jersey’s history organizations so that they are better able to attract, engage, and serve visitors, both during and after RevolutionNJ. Demonstrate how understanding the complexity of our history helps us to respond to the present and prepare for the future. “Initiatives like RevolutionNJ are critical to providing the blueprint for success, but there also needs to be timely, proactive funding to conduct the research, interpretation, and planning necessary to tell the inclusive stories we strive to promote during America’s 250th anniversary and beyond,” added Sara Cureton, executive director of the New Jersey Historical Commission. “This is exactly the purpose of the Inclusive History Grant Program, and why we will continue to build on this progress in the months and years ahead.” For more information on the NJHC’s grant programs, including the IHGP grant guidelines, please visit our homepage: History.NJ.gov . The NJHC’s grant awards are determined through an independent peer-review process. All funding is made possible by a portion of the revenue produced by the state’s Hotel/Motel Tax legislation.
