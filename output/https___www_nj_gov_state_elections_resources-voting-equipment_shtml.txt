Voting Equipment Certification In New Jersey, State Law (Title 19) requires that voting equipment: (1) may be adopted, rented, purchased or used by any county so long as that system has been thoroughly tested and is reliable; and (2) must be certified for use by the State. Further, the Help America Vote Act ("HAVA") sets forth voluntary standards for voting equipment and voting procedures to be used in federal elections, for the purpose of protecting the individual right to vote and assuring the accuracy for, and confidence in, the electoral process.
