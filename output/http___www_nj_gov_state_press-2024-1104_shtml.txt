Tahesha Way, Lt. Governor and Secretary of State New Jersey Puerto Rico Commission condemns anti-Puerto Rico remarks Trenton - Today, the New Jersey Puerto Rico Commission joins Governor Phil Murphy with a unified voice to condemn and admonish the anti-Puerto Rican, anti-Latino, and bigoted statements made by Tony Hinchcliffe, on behalf of former President Donald Trump at Madison Square Garden. These vicious statements represent the disconcerting trend of vilification against Latinos that perpetuate harmful stereotypes and amplify division. Puerto Ricans are integral to the fabric of our nation’s complicated history-their contributions forge and brighten our shared future as Americans. New Jersey is home to about half a million Puerto Ricans, having welcomed nearly 30,000 residents following Hurricane Maria in 2018. Latinos represent about 22% of the state’s population, contributing richly to our cultural, social, and economic landscape. Here in New Jersey, we take pride in our diversity and embrace our Latino families. Our communities deserve leaders at all levels of government who embrace them, fight for them, and uplift them. The NJ Puerto Rico Commission looks forward to continuing its mission to embrace, uplift, and support Puerto Ricans.
