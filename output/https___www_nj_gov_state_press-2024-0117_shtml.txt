Tahesha Way, Lt. Governor and Secretary of State NJBAC Welcomes First Group of Instructors for the Cannabis Training Academy January 17, 2024 (Trenton, NJ) - The NJ Business Action Center (NJBAC), which operates within the Department of State, has selected its first group of Cannabis Training Academy (CTA) instructors to assist in building out New Jersey’s cannabis technical assistance program. Set to launch in 2024, the CTA will provide individuals, particularly those from underserved communities disproportionately impacted by cannabis prohibition and those that reside in designated Impact Zones, with the proper information and education to pursue an adult-use cannabis operator's license. The program also will help individuals determine whether the cannabis industry is right fit for their business aspirations. Enrolled students will have access to reliable information from trusted sources that either work or teach in or consult to the New Jersey cannabis industry. “We look forward to launching the Cannabis Training Academy in 2024. This program will build upon the work happening throughout state government to create a more equitable, inclusive, and diverse cannabis industry,” said Lieutenant Governor Tahesha Way , who leads the New Jersey Department of State in her capacity as Secretary of State. “Our goal is to provide key support to Jersey-owned, Jersey-local, entrepreneurs who are interested in pursuing a recreational cannabis license through this virtual technical assistance program,” said NJBAC Executive Director, Melanie Willoughby . “We are proud to provide resources and support to budding cannabis entrepreneurs and current local operators who are striving to make a positive impact in their communities.” “The New Jersey cannabis community is an important partner to build out this academy,” added Penni Wild, NJBAC Deputy Executive Director . “More than 250 people formally expressed interest in applying to be a CTA instructor. After three months of screening, vetting and interviews, the first 25 instructors have been selected to help us initiate and launch this first-of-its kind cannabis technical assistance program in New Jersey.” “Each of our selected instructors bring years of experience, success, some painful lessons learned, and deep insight to budding entrepreneurs who are interested in stepping into the Garden State’s cannabis industry,” added CTA Executive Director Tauhid Chappell . “Many have personally written and submitted applications for, and have succeeded in winning, cannabis licenses in New Jersey and/or other states too. This wealth of knowledge gives us confidence that prospective CTA students will be getting the most relevant, on-the-ground, guidance and wisdom from those who’ve been through the exact process and know what it takes to enter and thrive in this industry.” From June to November 2023 the Cannabis Training Academy team conducted their CTA Instructor hiring journey. Following initial outreach and promotion of the CTA Instructor role, the team screened resumes and applications, organized and conducted in-depth interviews, and then selected their first cohort of instructors for the program. Initial outreach enabled 250 people to express interest in applying for the CTA Instructor role. More than 200 people began or completed their instructor application and uploaded their resume for interview consideration More than 150 peoples applications were deemed fully complete to move into interview consideration, and of those 150 people, 64 people were selected for final interviews. Over 8 weeks between October and November the CTA team interviewed 64 prospective CTA Instructors. From those interviews, 25 people were selected as final instructors. The selected 25 CTA Instructors, and their designated courses, are: Rosemarie Moyeno Matos – Gaining Municipal Proof of Local Support Chuck Latini – Understanding Zoning Approvals and Site Plans Stephanie Thomas - Real Estate Considerations Cecilia Oyediran – Understanding The Application Scoring Criteria and Application Fees, Writing Your Personal History & Entity Disclosure Forms and Submitting A Successful Application Chirali Patel – Understanding and Drafting Business Plan and Management Profiles, Writing A Regulatory Compliance Plan, Preparing your Conditional Application Submission, and Understanding the Conditional Conversion Application Process Lauren Rudick – Crafting and Understanding Business Formation Documents, Understanding Management Service Agreements ("MSA") and Financial Source Agreements ("FSA"), and Understanding Vendor Contractor Agreements Jessica Velazquez – Understanding Cannabis Taxation Dharshini Casinathen – Describing Your Business, Drafting Mission Statement & Value Propositions, Organizing A Qualified Team, Describing Your Products and Services, Writing An Executive Summary Devan McLaren – Creating A Financial Forecasting Plan James E.
