Tahesha Way, Lt. Governor and Secretary of State LT. GOVERNOR TAHESHA WAY REMINDS ELIGIBLE VOTERS OF THREE WAYS TO VOTE IN UPCOMING NOV. 7 GENERAL ELECTION TRENTON, NJ, Sept. 26, 2023 – New Jersey is once again making it safe, simple, and secure for eligible voters to participate in the upcoming November 7, 2023, General Election, according to Lieutenant Governor Tahesha Way, who oversees the New Jersey Division of Elections in her capacity as Secretary of State. The state is providing three convenient ways to vote, with information on each available at VOTE.NJ.GOV : At Polling Place on Election Day In-Person Early Voting Using a Mail-in Ballot “New Jersey’s eligible voters should know that it’s never been more convenient to exercise their right to vote,” said Lieutenant Governor Way. “Whether they choose to participate in the early voting period, October 28 – November 5, use a mail-in ballot, or come out on Election Day, voters can find all the information needed at vote.nj.gov. The site makes it easy to check everything from their registration status and polling place location, to county early voting sites and secure dropboxes. It’s all at their fingertips.” “New Jersey voters have three great options to choose from when they make their plan to vote,” said Assistant Secretary of State Dr. Lauren Zyriek Enriquez, who serves as Acting Director for the New Jersey Division of Elections. “County clerks are sending mail-in ballots for this election to those voters who requested them and voters can continue to request their ballot until November 6th, 3 p.m., the day before Election Day. Voters can also choose to vote during the nine-day early voting period at a county polling location. Of course, thousands of local polling places will be open for voters on Election Day, November 7th, as well. No matter which way New Jersey voters choose to participate, we encourage every eligible voter to make their mark and vote in this year’s election.” Following are details and important dates on the three ways to vote in the upcoming General Election: 1. At Local Polling Place on General Election Day Eligible registered voters can cast their ballot in person at their polling place from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Election Day, November 7. Accommodations will be made for voters with disabilities. Go to VOTE.NJ.GOV for polling places, which are listed on the Polling Locations page . 2. In-Person Early Voting: October 28 – November 5 This option enables all eligible registered voters to cast their ballot in person, using a voting machine prior to Election Day . Voters can choose to vote, in person, when it is most convenient for their schedule. No matter where a voter lives in their county, they can cast their specific ballot at any of their county’s designated in-person early voting locations. County locations can be found at VOTE.NJ.GOV . Hours will be Monday-Saturday, 10:00 a.m.–8:00 p.m. and Sunday, 10:00 a.m.–6:00 p.m. No appointment is necessary. Accommodations will be made for voters with disabilities. 3. Using A Mail-In Ballot Eligible registered voters can apply for a mail-in ballot by following the instructions found at VOTE.NJ.GOV or contacting their County Clerk. Voters will not automatically receive a mail-in ballot to participate in the November 7 General Election . Instructions to vote by mail include: Go to the Vote-By-Mail page on VOTE.NJ.GOV to download and print an Application for a Mail-in Ballot. Then, mail or deliver the completed application to the voter’s County Clerk. To receive a ballot by mail for the November 7 General Election, the application must be received by October 31 . Apply in person at a voter’s County Clerk office by 3:00 p.m. on November 6 for the November 7 General Election. Find the contact details at VOTE.NJ.GOV .
