Tahesha Way, Lt. Governor and Secretary of State New Jersey Launches Online Voter Registration Trenton, NJ – This week, New Jersey’s Division of Elections launched the state’s first online voter registration tool. The platform for online registration allows registering voters to provide their information electronically. Previously, those registering to vote needed to print, sign, and mail a registration form. Voters can find the tool by selecting “Register to Vote!” on the Division of Elections website (elections.nj.gov). Since its launch on Friday September 4, 2020, the online voter registration tool has been used to successfully register 12,858 voters. “With the launch of online voter registration, New Jersey has expanded access to our democracy,” said Secretary of State Tahesha Way, New Jersey’s top election official. “Especially as we face this ongoing pandemic, we are committed to reducing barriers that may prevent potential voters from participating in our elections.” Back to top Original text Rate this translation Your feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate
