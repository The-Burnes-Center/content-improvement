Tahesha Way, Lt. Governor and Secretary of State New Jersey Historical Commission Votes on FY 2012 General Operating Support Grants Investment Strengthens Economic and Creative Vitality of Communities in Every County TRENTON, NJ – The New Jersey Historical Commission met on July 21, 2011 in Trenton and approved $2,355,000 in General Operating Support grants to a total of 75 historical organizations, museums, historic sites, archives and libraries throughout New Jersey. The Historical Commission’s General Operating Support program is designed to assist in developing the capacity of historical organizations caring for collections and providing programs and services relating to New Jersey history. Investment in the program enables the Commission to fulfill its mission to enrich the lives of New Jersey residents by preserving the historical record and advancing interest in and awareness of the state’s past. Through the award of 75 operating grants in FY 2012 the Commission joins with the history community to collectively achieve important goals, including raising public awareness of state history, increasing public access to history collections and participation in history programming, facilitating new research and programming, and advancing preservation and collections care. Our state’s historical organizations provide valuable public services that include enriching New Jersey’s classrooms and the education of its children as they welcome students to their sites, assist teachers with curriculum development, and provide internships to foster the next generation of history patrons and professionals. Beyond servicing our youth and teachers in FY 2010, history organizations offered on and off-site programs to over 23.7 million people and supported over 480 jobs. The New Jersey Historical Commission’s grants are determined by a peer review process and funding is made possible by a portion of the revenue produced by the state’s Hotel/Motel Tax legislation.
