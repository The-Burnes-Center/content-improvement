Tahesha Way, Lt. Governor and Secretary of State New Jersey Historical Commission Board Approves $5.2 million in Statewide Fiscal Year 2024 General Operating Support, Project, Co-Sponsored Project, and County History Partnership Program Grant Support Funding will Support History Organizations, Projects, and Programs across all 21 Counties Trenton, NJ - Advancing the unique and diverse history within New Jersey and addressing essential institutional needs across the field, the New Jersey Historical Commission (NJHC) has approved $5.2 million in Fiscal Year 2024 (FY 24) grant funding to nearly 100 historical organizations, museums, historic sites, archives, individuals, and county re-grant agencies across the state. The $5.2 million in FY 24 funding will support the New Jersey Historical Commission’s General Operating Support (GOS) program, which covers a range of operational expenses for qualified history organizations; Projects and Co-Sponsored Projects, which includes New Jersey-based historical research, exhibits, programs, and archival work; and the County History Partnership Program (CHPP), which provides all 21 counties with funding for local history groups statewide. “These awards are vital to nurturing the growth of New Jersey’s history organizations and expanding their capacity and programmatic resources at this critical time,” noted Secretary of State Tahesha Way. “It will also support our ongoing commitment to promoting best practices in inclusive history, fostering civic engagement, and ensuring this funding supports a diverse array of initiatives and audiences across the state.” The return on investment in GOS funding alone is extraordinary. In Fiscal Year 2022, the 44 history organizations across the state that received $2.8 million in General Operating Support (GOS) funding leveraged $29 million in overall matching dollars, $24 million in total spending, offered on-and-off-site programs to around 1.3 million visitors, hosted nearly 11 million website visitors, and supported over 600 full and part-time jobs statewide. “These grant initiatives will not only go towards sustaining our history non-profits financially, but also support growth in the field through our Inclusive History Grant Program and DEAI training,” said Sara Cureton, executive director of the New Jersey Historical Commission. “Ensuring that history sites remain at the forefront of best practices is more important than ever as we plan for the upcoming 250th commemoration through the state’s RevolutionNJ initiative.” For more information on the Commission’s grant programs, including the grant guidelines, please visit the New Jersey Historical Commission’s homepage: History.NJ.gov . The New Jersey Historical Commission’s grant awards are determined through an independent peer-review process. All funding is made possible by a portion of the revenue produced by the state’s Hotel/Motel Tax legislation.
