Tahesha Way, Lt. Governor and Secretary of State New Jersey Historical Commission Board Approves $2.5 Million in Fiscal Year 2017 General Operating Support, Project, and County History Partnership Program Grant Funding Investment Strengthens Christie Administration’s Support for Statewide Historical Organizations TRENTON, N.J. – Furthering the Christie Administration’s ongoing commitment to preserving and advancing New Jersey’s unique historical legacy, the New Jersey Historical Commission today approved 81 Fiscal Year 2017 General Operating Support, Project, and County History Partnership Program grants to historical organizations, individuals, museums, historic sites, archives, libraries, and county re-granting agencies throughout the state. The $2.5 million in awards are the first to incorporate changes stemming from a comprehensive and lengthy grant reevaluation process. “This funding will have an immediate and profound impact in raising awareness of New Jersey’s essential place in American history across an array of disciplines and programs for educators, scholars, students, and history enthusiasts alike,” said Lt. Governor Kim Guadagno, who serves concurrently as Secretary of State. “Equally important, it recognizes the positive effect these organizations have on economic growth and investment in cities and towns across New Jersey.” In Fiscal Year 2015, organizations that received General Operating Support funding alone offered on and off-site programs to nearly 1.6 million people, enjoyed 10.3 million virtual visitors, and supported over 600 full and part-time jobs statewide. “We’re excited to embark on this exciting new chapter in presenting our grant programs,” noted Historical Commission Executive Director Sara Cureton. “The thorough reevaluation process has allowed us to maximize every dollar of grant funding in a manner that not only embraces critical nationwide efforts to reach larger and more diverse audiences but strengthens our relationship with vital county history and heritage partners.” Begun in 2014, the grant reevaluation process saw the Historical Commission consult a wide variety of grantees, applicants, potential applicants, and experts from various disciplines and geographic regions to gather input on how already effective grant programs could be strengthened further. Upon the approval of the Commission’s board, the changes were formally incorporated into the FY 2017 guidelines of the General Operating Support, Project, and County History Partnership grant programs, respectively. For more information on the eligibility and purpose of each program, including the guidelines themselves, please visit the Historical Commission’s homepage: History.NJ.gov . The New Jersey Historical Commission’s grant programs are determined through an independent, third-party peer review process. All funding is made possible by a portion of the revenue produced by the state’s Hotel/Motel Tax legislation.
