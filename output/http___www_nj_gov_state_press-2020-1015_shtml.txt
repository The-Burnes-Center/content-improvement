Tahesha Way, Lt. Governor and Secretary of State New Jersey Historical Commission Board Approves $3.051 Million in Statewide Fiscal Year 2021 General Operating Support, Project, and County History Partnership Program Grant Support Funding to Support History Organizations, Projects, and Programs across all 21 Counties Trenton, NJ – Addressing the critical institutional needs of New Jersey’s history community amid the ongoing financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the New Jersey Historical Commission (NJHC) approved $3.051 million in Fiscal Year 2021 (FY 21) grant funding to 84 historical organizations, museums, historic sites, archives, libraries, individuals, and county re-grant agencies across the state. The funding will further advance the NJHC’s continuing mission to raise awareness of the state’s unique and diverse historical legacy and chronicle its ongoing impact on the nation and world. The $3.051 million in FY 21 funding will support the New Jersey Historical Commission’s General Operating Support (GOS) program, which covers an array of operational expenses for qualified history organizations; Projects and Co-Sponsored Projects, which includes New Jersey-based historical research, exhibits, programs, and archival work; and the County History Partnership Program (CHPP), which provides all 21 counties with funding for local history groups statewide. “There has never been a more important grant round than the one the New Jersey Historical Commission has just approved,” noted Secretary of State Tahesha Way. “The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged our cultural organizations in unprecedented ways. This increased funding not only illustrates our steadfast commitment to the state’s history community, but will provide the foundation to assist in the recovery and growth of educational programs and services that are critical to both New Jersey residents and visitors.” In Fiscal Year 2019, history organizations that received approximately $1.45 million in General Operating Support (GOS) funding alone leveraged nearly $21 million in total spending, generated over $22 million in total income, offered on-and-off-site programs to 2.2 million people (including more than 270,000 K-12 students), enjoyed around 7 million website visitors, and supported 700 full and part-time jobs statewide. “The challenges ahead for the New Jersey Historical Commission and its grantees in these unprecedented times are considerable,” said Sara Cureton, its executive director. “This essential funding is invaluable, allowing us to support history-related jobs and innovative resources to serve diverse audiences, provide fact-based historical context to contemporary issues, and ensure history organizations remain an integral part of our communities.” For more information on the Commission’s grant programs, including the grant guidelines, please visit the New Jersey Historical Commission’s homepage: History.NJ.gov . The New Jersey Historical Commission’s grant awards are determined through an independent peer-review process. All funding is made possible by a portion of the revenue produced by the state’s Hotel/Motel Tax legislation.
