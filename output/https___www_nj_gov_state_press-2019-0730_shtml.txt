Tahesha Way, Lt. Governor and Secretary of State New Jersey Historical Commission Board Approves $2.4 Million in Statewide Fiscal Year 2020 General Operating Support, Project, and County History Partnership Program Grant Support Funding to Support History Organizations, Projects, and Programs across all 21 Counties TRENTON, NJ – Advancing its mission to raise awareness of the state’s unique historical legacy and chronicle its ongoing impact on the nation and world, the New Jersey Historical Commission board today approved $2.4 million in Fiscal Year 2020 (FY 20) grant funding to 72 historical organizations, museums, historic sites, archives, libraries, individuals, and county re-grant agencies across the state. The $2.4 million in FY 20 funding will support the New Jersey Historical Commission’s General Operating Support (GOS) program, which covers an array of operational expenses for qualified history organizations; Projects and Co-Sponsored Projects, which includes New Jersey-based historical research, exhibits, programs, and archival work; and the County History Partnership Program (CHPP), which provides all 21 counties with funding for local history groups statewide. “The Department of State is responsible for enhancing the quality of life across New Jersey in so many essential ways, from promoting civic engagement, expanding economic vitality, and broadening the knowledge of the state’s exceptional cultural resources,” noted Secretary of State Tahesha Way. “This funding strengthens that commitment by providing critical educational and organizational support to advance awareness of New Jersey’s past, showcase the state’s unique role in shaping American history, and guide the future by understanding the past.” In Fiscal Year 2018, history organizations that received approximately $1.45 million in General Operating Support (GOS) funding alone leveraged nearly $22 million in total spending, generated over $24 million in total income, offered on-and-off-site programs to about 2 million people (including more than 300,000 K-12 students), enjoyed around 5.6 million website visitors, and supported 700 full and part-time jobs statewide. “These grants support the mission of the New Jersey Historical Commission in many critical ways,” said Sara Cureton, its executive director. “They not only offer crucial organizational and programmatic support, but will encourage grantees to continually attract new and diverse audiences, connect history to contemporary issues, and lay the groundwork for long-term growth and sustainability.” For more information on the eligibility and purpose of each grant program, including the grant guidelines, please visit the New Jersey Historical Commission’s homepage: History.NJ.gov . The New Jersey Historical Commission’s grant programs are determined through an independent, third-party peer review process. All funding is made possible by a portion of the revenue produced by the state’s Hotel/Motel Tax legislation.
