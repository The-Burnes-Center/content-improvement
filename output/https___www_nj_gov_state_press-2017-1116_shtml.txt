Tahesha Way, Lt. Governor and Secretary of State New Jersey Cultural Trust Approves Over $300,000 in FY 2018 Capital Historic Preservation Grants Awards to Support Diverse Improvement and Restoration Projects across New Jersey TRENTON, N.J. – Advancing its ongoing commitment to preserving and protecting New Jersey’s rich and diverse historic resources, the New Jersey Cultural Trust (NJCT) has announced $304,655 in FY 2018 Capital Historic Preservation grant awards to 13 qualified organizations and projects statewide. With the FY 2018 grant awards, the Cultural Trust has now approved over $7 million in financial stabilization and historic preservation projects across New Jersey to date. Pursuant to the Cultural Trust Act of 2000, annual NJCT grants are awarded following a third-party, independent peer review process and are based on recommendations from the New Jersey State Council on the Arts, New Jersey Historical Commission, and the New Jersey Historic Trust. For FY 2018, recommendations were made by the New Jersey Historic Trust. “The work of the New Jersey Cultural Trust is unique and unlike any other agency across state government, and these FY 2018 awards illustrate how important its work remains to the state’s arts and history communities,“ said Sara Cureton, executive director of the New Jersey Cultural Trust. “This year’s grants will facilitate important repairs and improvements to several historic properties and, in doing so, will help ensure their enduring historical legacy and appeal to visitors for years to come.“ For the FY 2018 round, awards of up to $25,000 were available for eligible activities including stabilization, repair, restoration, adaptive reuse and improvements to cultural or historic properties, including adapting for increased accessibility. In addition, all project proposals must be in conformance with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. All history, arts, and humanities organizations with stewardship responsibility for historic resources that are listed on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places, and qualified by the New Jersey Cultural Trust, were eligible to apply for FY 2018 capital historic preservation funding.

This is achieved through the establishment of a permanent, interest-generating fund to be an additional source of revenue to nonprofit arts, history, and humanities organizations. The NJCT provides grants to support capital projects, endowments, and institutional and financial stabilization of arts, history, and humanities organizations in New Jersey. Funding for the grants comes from interest earned on the Cultural Trust Fund, which is a permanent investment fund.
