Tahesha Way, Lt. Governor and Secretary of State NJ Motion Picture Commission and NBCUniversal Announce Third Diverse Production Assistant Bootcamp Free Diverse Production Assistant Training Program Open To 30 New Jersey Residents ATLANTIC CITY , NJ -The Motion Picture and Television Commission encourages New Jersey residents interested in pursuing a career in film and television production to apply for the upcoming Production Assistant Bootcamp scheduled for Dec. 7 and 8 in Atlantic City. The Diverse Production Assistant (P.A.) Bootcamp training program is a two-day thorough, intensive, real-world work-based job training program that provides an opportunity to gain skills, knowledge and understanding of a film/TV production. The program trains individuals from diverse backgrounds for the job of Production Assistant, which is the entry level gateway into the entertainment industry as it has been for many highly successful producers, directors and crew currently working in the industry. The training program is provided free of charge to accepted participants, thanks to the generous sponsorship of NBCUniversal. December’s P.A. Bootcamp, conducted in partnership with the Atlantic City Film Commission, will be third of its kind sponsored by NBCUniversal in New Jersey. Thus far, 57 New Jersey residents from diverse backgrounds have participated in the P.A. Bootcamps. Following her successful completion of the program earlier this year, A'layeah Joisanne, a 24-year old resident of Montclair, was immediately hired as a production assistant on the Universal Television series “The Enemy Within,” which filmed in New Jersey. “Attending the P.A. Bootcamp helped me develop the skills, experience, and relationships I need to not only get a job as a production assistant, but truly hit the ground running,” said Josianne. “Thanks to this program, I am embarking on my dream career and I have the tools and knowledge I need to be an asset on set to the cast and crew.” The two-day weekend training program is designed to train Set and Office Production Assistants. Participants will learn everything necessary to walk on any film or television set and do the job right from day one. Although a job after the Bootcamp is not guaranteed, with an increase in film and television production in the State, the demand for qualified P.A.s has risen. Interested residents can learn more at www.pabootcamp.com and apply via email. Write to: productionassistanttraining@gmail.com and place Atlantic City Bootcamp in the subject line. The email should include your name, email, phone number and a short paragraph explaining why you want to attend. All applicants will be interviewed by phone prior to their acceptance.

Applicants MUST be able to attend training on BOTH Dec. 7 and Dec. 8 and be able to accept Production Assistant work in New Jersey in the next several months.
