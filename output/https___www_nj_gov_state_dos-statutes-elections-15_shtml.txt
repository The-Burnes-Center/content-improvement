Parking spaces for individuals with a disability shall be located as close as possible to elevators, ramps, walkways, and the accessible entrance they serve. Parking spaces shall be as level as possible. Each parking space shall be identified with an above grade sign displaying the International Symbol of Accessibility and appropriate wordage. In all configurations, to the degree feasible, accessible parking spaces shall be located so that individuals with a disability are not compelled to wheel or walk behind parked cars.

A curb ramp shall never be located where it would be blocked by a parked vehicle. In all configurations, provisions such as curb or bumpers should be included to prevent parked vehicles from blocking accessible walkways.

In the event that off street metered parking is provided, such accessible parking spaces shall be reserved for individuals with disabilities by installing a meter cap over the meter.

The standards for accessible routes shall conform to the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1201 et seq. (d) All ramps and curb ramps on accessible routes shall comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1201 et seq., except those curb cuts or curb ramps constructed within a public street. These structures shall meet the requirements of the respective public, city, county, or State agency having jurisdiction. (e) Accessible entrances shall conform to the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1201 et seq. All accessible entrances shall be identified by the "International Symbol of Accessibility". Doors should be easily opened by individuals with a disability and the elderly.

Signs informing voters of an alternative accessible entrance shall be clearly posted and shall display the "International Symbol of Accessibility" as well as appropriate wordage to include "ACCESSIBLE ENTRANCE".

The committee shall indicate the reasons for inaccessibility, according to guidelines established in the Federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq., and shall consult with the county board of election to determine the efforts made pursuant to P.L. 1991, c. 429 (N.J.S.A. 19:8-3.1 et seq.) to locate alternative polling places or the actions needed to make the existing facilities accessible. Each county board of election shall notify the Secretary of State and the committee of any changes in polling place locations before the next general election, including any changes required due to the alteration of district boundaries. Each county board of elections office is required to complete a "Polling Place Accessibility Checklist" for each polling place located within their jurisdiction. This checklist requires the members of the county boards of elections, and/or members of their Voting Accessibility Advisory Committee, to physically evaluate the accessibility status of parking facilities, exterior and interior routes of travel, ramps and curb ramps, and entrances of each polling place. Evaluations are required to note the accessibility status of each area and to provide comments where needed. Based upon Polling Place Accessibility Checklist evaluations, each county board of elections is required to determine and to note the accessibility of each polling place. In instances where a polling place is determined to be inaccessible and is reported as such, a "Polling Place Accessibility Waiver Request" shall be completed and attached to the inaccessibility polling place's accessibility checklist. The Secretary of State is provided authority to grant a waiver, in certain cases, to polling places which have been evaluated as inaccessible. In order for the Secretary of State to consider granting any waivers for inaccessible polling places, affected county boards of elections shall not only complete the required waiver form, they shall also document on this form the measures that their office has undertaken to either make this polling place accessible or to relocate such an inaccessible polling place to an alternate accessible location place. While the completion of a Polling Place Accessibility Waiver Form is required for each inaccessible polling place, such a form does not guarantee that inaccessible places will be granted waiver. Waivers will be granted by the Secretary of State only in those instances when an inaccessible polling place and its affected facilities cannot be made accessible and alternative accessible locations are not available. Only two such waivers shall be granted for such polling place and each waiver shall be one year in duration. A Polling Place Accessibility Report shall be completed by each county board of elections. Such reports shall include: The total number of polling places within each county; The total number of polling places that have been evaluated using the Secretary of State's "Polling Place Accessibility Checklist" and have been found to be either accessible or inaccessible; and A listing of the reason(s) for any instance(s) of inaccessibility.
