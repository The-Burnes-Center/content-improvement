Tahesha Way, Lt. Governor and Secretary of State Programs Annual King Holiday Commemorative Celebration The Annual King Holiday Commemorative Celebration is held on or about the third Sunday in January of each year in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s birthday. The Commemorative Celebration brings together a diverse group of people to celebrate Dr. King’s life’s work and legacy. It also allows New Jerseyans an opportunity to recommit themselves to fulfilling Dr. King’s dreams in the 21st century. The Commemorative Celebration continues to be the premier event in the State of New Jersey that honors Dr. King. “Behold” Sculpture The Commission coordinates programming around “Behold”, the ten-foot, bonded-bronze sculpture. The State of New Jersey purchased this casting of “Behold” shortly before an outdoor, bronze casting was installed permanently on a site overlooking the tomb of Dr. King at the King National Historic Site in Atlanta, Georgia in 1990. In June of the same year, the Commission installed its casting of the “Behold” statue at Essex County College in Newark, where it was unveiled and has remained on public exhibition.
