To book an appointment please visit our online appointment page . For more information on hours, directions, and scheduling process, please go to Planning Your Visit . The State Archives is New Jersey's official research center for public records of enduring historical value. Considering that many vital records, land documents, probate records and military service papers were filed centrally by the Colony and State of New Jersey, the State Archives is a treasure trove for genealogists and historians. The State Archives is also the official repository for microfilm of county clerks’ and surrogates’ records produced by the LDS Church and of film of local newspapers produced by the New Jersey Newspaper Project. Current holdings amount to over 37,000 cubic feet of paper records and over 32,000 reels of microfilm. Our records date from the founding of New Jersey as a British colony in 1664 up to the present. Located at 225 West State Street in downtown Trenton, the State Archives provides assistance to thousands of researchers annually. The collections are open to the general public free of charge, although there are fees for photocopies and reprographic services. Certain collections can be searched through this site and/or by mail. Effective July 1, 2012, oversight of the records management, records storage, imaging and micrographic functions of the Division of Archives and Records Management was transferred to the Division of Revenue and Enterprise Services in the Department of the Treasury.
