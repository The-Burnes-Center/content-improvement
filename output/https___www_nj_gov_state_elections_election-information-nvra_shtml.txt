Known as the “Motor Voter” law, it is intended to increase the number of citizens who register to vote, increase voter participation, and protect the integrity of the electoral process. The law established a variety of mechanisms to make it easier for Americans to exercise their right to vote. "Motor Voter" NVRA requires that individuals be given an opportunity to register to vote or to update their voter registration information when applying for a driver’s license or other personal identification issued by a Motor Vehicle Commission Agency. The opportunity to register to vote shall be offered to citizens applying for a Driver’s license (new applicant, renewal or change of address). "Voter Registration Agency" NVRA requires public assistance or State-funded programs engaged in providing services to persons with disabilities (new applicant, recertification, renewal or change of address).
