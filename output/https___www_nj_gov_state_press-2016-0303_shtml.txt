Tahesha Way, Lt. Governor and Secretary of State Lt. Governor Guadagno Attends New Jersey Tourism Industry Association Luncheon Celebrates Tourism Successes and Improved Numbers TRENTON, N.J. – Lt. Governor Kim Guadagno today attended the New Jersey Tourism Industry Association Luncheon to discuss the New Jersey Tourism Industry and its improvements post-Sandy. New Jersey again set a record in 2015, with the tourism industry accounting for $43.4 billion in economic impact – an increase of more than 3 percent over the previous year. This was in part due to an increase in visitation to New Jersey, which increased for the sixth straight year. The number of visitors to New Jersey increased by 2.4 percent last year to 95 million. “New Jersey continues to be a great vacation destination and the 2015 tourism report unveiled today confirms just that,” said Lt. Governor Guadagno. “These impressive results verify that are our promotional efforts are yielding great returns for the citizens of our great state.” In 2015, the tourism industry directly supported more than 318,330 jobs. When factoring in indirect impacts, more than a half million jobs – or nearly one in ten of all New Jersey jobs – depended on tourism. The New Jersey Division of Travel and Tourism recently released promising numbers from the past year. In 2015, 20 of 21 counties saw an increase in tourism industry revenues. Passaic County saw a 9.9 percent increase in tourism spending, Cumberland County was up 8.8 percent and Hudson County was up 8.6 percent.
