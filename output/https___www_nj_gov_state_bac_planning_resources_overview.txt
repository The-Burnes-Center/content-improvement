Tahesha Way, Lt. Governor and Secretary of State Resources Overview NJOPA Reference Materials NJ Warehouse Guidance Resiliency Guidelines State Planning Rules Plan Endorsement Materials Plan Endorsement is a voluntary process established at the state level in New Jersey to promote consistency between local master plans and the goals and objectives of the State Development and Redevelopment Plan (State Plan). The Plan Endorsement process is administered by the State Planning Commission with the participation of a variety of state agencies. Outline of the PE Process PE Endorsement Guidelines County/Regional PE Guidelines Process Documents Municipal Self-Assessment Template PE Benefits NJ Office of Planning Advocacy and SPC and Sustainable Jersey Synergy Proposal (and Resolution) Climate Resiliency Resources Climate resilience is the ability to recover quickly and fully from climate-related issues or events, instead of simply reacting to them as they occur. It involves having the appropriate laws, policies, and procedures in place so that state and local responses can be effective and swift when there is a climate-related event. It also means that communities are proactively assessing their climate vulnerabilities and developing strategies to address them—before a damaging event occurs. It’s a framework to continually engage with the dynamic set of conditions that a changing climate brings through an ongoing process of learning from and redesigning for the impacts of climate change.
