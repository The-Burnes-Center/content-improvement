Tahesha Way, Secretary of State Chat with us or call us at 1-800-Jersey-7 About the CTA In 2022 the New Jersey Business Action Center (NJBAC) was designated by the New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory Commission (NJ-CRC) to build and launch the Cannabis Training Academy (NJ CTA), a no-cost technical assistance training program that provides education about the cannabis industry in New Jersey, highlights opportunities within the industry—whether they involve directly handling the plant or not—and guide participants on how to apply for a state license, empowering them to take meaningful steps toward success in this evolving market. The goal is to provide students with comprehensive education about the New Jersey cannabis industry, including its history, the impact of cannabis prohibition, current laws and regulations, regulatory compliance, business and financial strategies, and the state licensing process. By learning from leading experts, including experienced cannabis operators, advocates and experienced professional service providers, students gain the knowledge and tools needed to make informed decisions that benefit themselves, their families, and their communities. The New Jersey CTA Curriculum At the heart of the NJ CTA exists 10 levels of more than 60 modules that teach students about the NJ CRC cannabis licensing application process. Virtual webinars including instructor Q&A sessions, and interviews with subject matter experts, legacy and regulated operators, ancillary service providers, and state government agencies that regulate or interact with the cannabis industry. RSVP opportunities to participate in online and physical events in and around New Jersey. Knowledge checks, comprehension quizzes and student surveys All educational material relating to New Jersey’s cannabis industry and its licensing application process are all available online and can be consumed at any time, any day, on your phone, computer, or laptop.
