Tahesha Way, Lt. Governor and Secretary of State RevolutionNJ Race Series Comes to Greenwich 5K race and one-mile family fun walk will be held through the streets of Greenwich on November 9, 2024 TRENTON, NJ – New Jersey is continuing its race to America’s 250th in 2026. RevolutionNJ, the state’s official partnership between the New Jersey Historical Commission and the nonprofit Crossroads of the American Revolution to commemorate the Semiquincentennial, is hosting a series of 5K races and one-mile family fun walks at historic sites across New Jersey. The 2024 Race Series has already visited Monmouth Battlefield State Park, Princeton Battlefield State Park, and East Jersey Old Towne Village. The races have drawn hundreds of participants from all walks of life. Attendees not only toured these historical sites, but also enjoyed historical reenactors and travelling exhibits from local organizations. The final race for 2024 will occur on November 9th in Greenwich, New Jersey. Racers and walkers alike will traverse through the town’s historic streets and will have the opportunity to learn more about the tea burning protest which occurred in Greenwich 250 years ago. All participants will receive a t-shirt and commemorative magnet, and runners will receive a finisher’s medal. Awards will be given to the top three fastest runners in each ten-year age category. “Our RevNJ Race Series is proving to be a fun way to enjoy New Jersey’s wonderful parks and historical sites while learning about our shared past in preparation for 2026,” says Lieutenant Governor Tahesha Way who oversees the New Jersey Historical Commission in her role as New Jersey’s Secretary of State. While the Greenwich event concludes RevolutionNJ’s 2024 Race Series, future races are being scheduled for the spring and fall of 2025. Those who complete each year’s full race series will receive a special commemorative medal. “The RevolutionNJ Race Series is one of the many ways that RevolutionNJ is fostering a multigenerational commemoration of the 250th,” said Sara Cureton, executive director of the New Jersey Historical Commission. “There’s a place for everyone in the festivities, whether they are an avid historian, recreational runner, or a family looking for ways to get outside on the weekend.” “Everyone’s coming together to learn about our past and support community health and well-being,” said Carrie Fellows, executive director of Crossroads of the American Revolution. “This type of creative historical events is vital to New Jersey’s heritage tourism industry, but just as importantly, they are good fun.” Information on joining this and all RevNJ events statewide can be found at https://revnj.org/calendar .
