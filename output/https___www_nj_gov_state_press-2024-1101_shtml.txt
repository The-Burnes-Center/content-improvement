Tahesha Way, Lt. Governor and Secretary of State Lieutenant Governor Way Reminds Voters to Avoid Electioneering Near Polling Locations The Division of Elections distributed an electioneering poster on Saturday, October 26th to aid county election officials and poll workers. They are displayed at polling locations and reiterates existing state law. “Voters should refrain from wearing or displaying anything that might be construed as support for or opposition to a candidate or campaign,” said Lieutenant Governor Tahesha Way. This guidance serves to inform voters that they are not permitted to “electioneer” within 100 feet from a polling location. Every eligible voter must be able to vote freely and fairly without intimidation or coercion. The notice reads: “ You Cannot Enter a Polling Place, or Stand within 100 feet of the Outside Entrance of a Polling Place, WEARING or DISPLAYING Anything that may offer Support for or opposition against any Candidate, Party or Public Question on the Ballot. That includes political badges, buttons, insignias, t-shirts, hats or other display that can be read or viewed to identify support or opposition of a candidate, political party or public questions.” A person violating any of the provisions shall be guilty of a disorderly persons offense.
