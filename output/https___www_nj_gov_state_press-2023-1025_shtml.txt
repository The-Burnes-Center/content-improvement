Tahesha Way, Lt. Governor and Secretary of State IN-PERSON EARLY VOTING BEGINS OCT. 28 FOR NJ GENERAL ELECTION Eligible Registered Voters Can Cast Ballots Early from Oct. 28 – Nov. 5 TRENTON, NJ, October 25, 2023 – All eligible registered New Jersey voters can participate in the 2023 General Election using the state’s in-person early voting option from October 28 through November 5. This option enables all eligible registered voters to cast their ballot in person at any early voting site in their county over the nine day voting period . Voters can choose to vote when it is most convenient for their schedule. No matter where a voter lives in their county, they can cast their specific ballot at any of their county’s designated in-person early voting locations. County locations can be found at Vote.NJ.Gov . Hours will be Monday-Saturday 10:00 a.m.–8:00 p.m., and Sunday 10:00 a.m.–6:00 p.m. No appointment is necessary. Accommodations will be made for voters with disabilities. “Early voting is all about making it easy for voters to exercise their right to vote,” said Lieutenant Governor Way, who oversees the New Jersey Division of Elections in her capacity as Secretary of State. “While some voters may not have the time to get out and vote on Election Day itself, in-person early voting allows nine days for folks to find the time that works best for their schedule to cast their ballot.” In-person early voting is one of three ways to vote in the election. County clerks are also sending mail-in ballots to those who requested them. To receive a ballot by mail for the November 7 General Election, the application must be received by October 31. Voters can apply in person at their County Clerk’s office by 3:00 p.m. on November 6 for the November 7 General Election. In addition, thousands of local polling places will be open for voters on Election Day itself. “With three convenient options to choose from, we encourage every eligible New Jersey voter to cast their ballot in this year’s election,” said Assistant Secretary of State Dr. Lauren Zyriek Enriquez, who serves as Acting Director for the New Jersey Division of Elections.
